            "Discrimination against transgender individuals has a major impact on their financial and economic security. Trans individuals in particular are 3 times as likely to face unemployment as the overall US labor force, with [1/5](https://transequality.org/issues/housing-homelessness) experiencing housing discrimination, and 1/3 living in poverty. Gender and racial disparities place additional disadvantage, with [34%](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/11/andrew-yang-freedom-dividend-will-create-accepting-nation/) of Black trans women facing housing insecurity, compared to 9% of non-Black trans people.\n\nThese economic disadvantages make trans people far more vulnerable to systemic threats of violence. Even though trans women of color make up only [18%](https://www.apa.org/pi/aids/resources/exchange/2018/03/transgender-women-hiv) of the transgender community, they account for [4/5](https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-transgender-community-in-2019) anti-transgender homicides. Transgender people are also [3](http://avp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ncavp_2012_hvreport_final.pdf) times more likely than the rest of the population to experience police violence. If incarcerated, trans people are [10](https://transequality.org/issues/police-jails-prisons) times as likely to be sexually assaulted by fellow inmates, often as a result of being placed in housing that is incongruent with their gender identity.\n\nTransphobic policies also prevent trans inmates from receiving necessary medical treatment while incarcerated. Additionally, in several states, gender affirmation healthcare and services are considered \"cosmetic\" and therefore are not required to be covered by many insurance plans. Planned Parenthood is one of the only organizations that provides non-discriminatory, knowledgeable, and respectful healthcare services for the transgender community. \n\nThe Freedom Dividend would be a game-changer for members of the community because it would help make it easier for people to leave environments that are unsupportive, hostile, or dangerous and move to environments that are more welcoming and supportive. It would reduce homelessness and the need for trans women to engage in risky forms of employment that put their safety at risk. Empowering people economically is only a piece of the solution to eliminate discrimination, but it's an essential start to giving people the power to make choices and care for themselves. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Members of the trans community, especially trans women of color, are at high risk for homelessness, poverty, violence, and incarceration.\n- The failure of our systems to include transgender people excludes them from basic freedoms and dignity. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- End the systemic threat and real violence against the trans community\n- Remove barriers to gender-affirming healthcare\n- Support transgender individuals economically with the Freedom Dividend",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Equip law enforcement to better identify and address hate-motivated violence, and provide officers with victim sensitivity training.\n- Improve the treatment of transgender inmates by providing adequate gender-affirming healthcare and ensuring gender-appropriate housing for inmates.\n- Ensure access to non-discriminatory gender-affirming healthcare and services.\n- Ensure the Freedom Dividend is effectively received by the most vulnerable communities.

            "Between puberty and peer pressure, middle and high schoolers are already drowning in stress, anxiety, and self-consciousness. LGBTQ+ youth often have the additional burden of feeling unsafe in their own homes or classrooms. Transgender students and those who identify as non-binary aren't even able to go to the restroom without feeling vulnerable and unsafe.\n\nIf 3 out of 4 LGBTQ+ students report feeling depressed, unsafe, or worthless, how can we expect them to focus on learning?\n\nA recent [HRC study](https://www.hrc.org/resources/2018-lgbtq-youth-report) shows that inclusive school environments are a critical factor in the healthy development of queer youth. Creating an inclusive school culture starts with teaching educators and administrators to be culturally competent and proficient in addressing important social issues like prejudice and discrimination. Appropriate LGBTQ+ support at every grade level can ensure a safe environment for all students.\n\nSimple steps like the presence of gender-neutral bathrooms and locker rooms not only provide practical safety and comfort for transgender and non-binary youth, but also destigmatize these identities and orientations, reducing the risk of bullying. The presence of [\"Safe School\" policies](http://www.whatkidscando.org/publications/pdfs/QueerYouthAdvice.pdf) that specifically address LGBTQ+ bullying has been proven effective at decreasing levels of LGBTQ+ related discrimination.\n\nInclusive school curricula should incorporate LGBTQ+ themes, like LGBTQ+ History Month. This inclusive teaching approach benefits not only queer youth, but also gives non-queer students an unbiased and thorough understanding of the LGBTQ+ community while learning how to promote [acceptance](https://www.accreditedschoolsonline.org/education-teaching-degree/lgbtq-youth/). Additionally, schools need to provide LGBTQ+ inclusive sex education, with information on gender identity and sexual orientation. ",

            "The American Dream has always represented opportunity for growth and success to anyone who puts in the work. Unfortunately, for working parents who can't afford childcare, or live in a childcare [desert](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2018/12/06/461643/americas-child-care-deserts-2018/), that dream is harder and harder. Today, childcare accounts for more than [10%](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3957809/costofcare2018.pdf?__hstc=&__hssc=&hsCtaTracking=b4367fa6-f3b9-4e6c-acf4-b5d01d0dc570%7C94d3f065-e4fc-4250-a163-bafc3defaf20') of the income of the average two-income household. It's even worse for single parents who are forced to dedicate over 27% of their income to basic childcare. These childcare costs are just a portion of the costs required to raise a child. When over one-third of an individual's annual salary goes into taking care of children, it doesn't leave much room for anything else.\n\nDespite its enormous wealth, the U.S. is among the 5 least affordable nations for childcare. This puts parents in an impossible situation and relegates many to poverty. People who are already at the poverty line struggle with making enough to cover childcare costs. This makes it impossible for parents to seek higher education or special training to climb the economic ladder and become more competitive in their employment. \n\nParents aren't the only ones who suffer as a result of poor access to quality childcare - kids do, too. High-quality childcare usually also provides high-quality early education. Early childhood education is correlated with greater academic achievement in adolescence and higher income and health outcomes later in life. We can set up our kids for success by providing them with high-quality education early in life while also taking the financial burden of childcare off of the back of parents.\n\nWhile investing in childcare would improve the wellbeing and financial security of American families, it would also contribute to a growing economy. When parents can't afford childcare, they often have to take a cut in hours, or leave their jobs altogether. An estimated [$28.9](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3957809/costofcare2018.pdf?__hstc=&__hssc=&hsCtaTracking=b4367fa6-f3b9-4e6c-acf4-b5d01d0dc570%7C94d3f065-e4fc-4250-a163-bafc3defaf20) billion in wages is lost annually by working families who do not have access to affordable childcare and paid family/medical leave.\n\nWhat most Americans don't know is that the U.S. already has a model for universal childcare that works incredibly well: [The Armed Forces childcare program](https://thinkprogress.org/universal-military-childcare-9bb2b54bd154/). As with many things, the U.S. military has set an example of efficient, high-quality, guaranteed childcare for all military families. This childcare program is based on a percentage of income, and a large portion of the program is subsidized by the government. This has resulted in the highest quality childcare that our country has to offer. All locations are licensed and supervised by trained professionals. Childcare workers receive higher wages and benefits than in the private sector. Parents report high levels of satisfaction with these programs. \n\nThe U.S. should adopt a similar program for the entire country to support all parents and families. The federal government should work with local governments and stakeholders to license and fund childcare centers that meet a high national standard for quality. This would mean community organizations, or even private citizens could access federal funds to open and run reliable, quality childcare centers that are held accountable to national standards. This will allow communities to adopt flexible childcare systems that address their unique needs without risking closure for a lack of demand. In cases where there isn't adequate infrastructure, we can expand existing federal infrastructure to ensure that every family has access to childcare, even those in current childcare deserts. \n\nFamilies earning less than $60,000 annually should be able to access this care free of cost. For higher-earning families, rates should be capped at a low percentage of income. The scope of this program is ambitious and would require $840 billion over 10 years, but it would be well worth it to lift families out of poverty and ensure that every child is set up to succeed. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Cost of childcare in the U.S. is unaffordable for most families, especially those of low income.\n- Unaffordable childcare reduces the economic power of families with children. \n- The lack of quality childcare impacts early childhood learning, which correlates with better academic achievement in adolescence and higher income and health outcomes later in life. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Make childcare affordable for all families",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Use the U.S. military's childcare program as a model for the country.\n- Invest in federal funding to incentivize both private and public childcare options.\n- Work with local communities to license and fund childcare centers that meet a national standard for quality.\n- Incentivize university campuses to have childcare, making higher education an option for more parents.\n- Encourage and incentivize state funded Pre-K beginning at age 3."

Crucial protections, like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, have enabled more women to continue working while pregnant without the concern of being forced to leave their jobs. However, pregnancy discrimination still persists, and reports illustrate it has risen dramatically in the last [15](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/pregnancy.cfm) years.\n\nMore than [250,000](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2015/1/07/states-go-beyond-federal-law-to-protect-pregnant-workers) women a year are denied reasonable accommodations by their employer for pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Pregnant women are often denied common sense accommodations like longer rest periods, stools at cash registers, or temporary reassignment to other tasks. Many new mothers are denied designated locations for expressing milk. This discrimination falls most heavily on women of color and those working low-wage jobs. Despite only comprising 14.3% of female workers, Black women filed [28.6%](https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/pregnancy-discrimination/by-the-numbers-women-continue-to-face-pregnancy-discrimination-in-the-workplace.pdf) of pregnancy discrimination charges. \n\nLack of fair accommodations during pregnancy and soon after birth have real consequences. Expecting mothers are forced to risk [miscarriage](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/21/business/pregnancy-discrimination-miscarriages.html), experience improper physical recovery, and are denied critical time to bond with their infants. To ensure the safety of pregnant workers, we must follow the lead of the 27 states that have passed legislation like the [Pregnant Worker Fairness Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2417/text). This legislation ensures reasonable workplace accommodations for those whose ability to work is limited by pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nNo woman should have to place her or her child's health at risk to keep her job. No woman should feel forced to choose between dedicated motherhood or continuing her career. Both are possible, and our laws have to support and protect pregnant women from discrimination. Fundamentally, we must recognize that if we fail to protect pregnancy in the workplace, we jeopardize both the health and well-being of pregnant workers and that of their future children and families. By recognizing the rights of pregnant workers, we can build a safer workforce, and stronger, healthier families. ",

            "True gender equality means fighting for not only equal pay for equal work, but also equal representation in leadership positions in government, the military, and the private sector.  In the United States, women make up less than [25%](https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-government/) of elected officials, only [5.2%](https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-sp-500-companies/) of CEOs, and [16%](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) of executive teams. These numbers do not add up considering women make up [51%](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-gender/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) of the population and [46%](https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2017/women-in-the-workforce-before-during-and-after-the-great-recession/pdf/women-in-the-workforce-before-during-and-after-the-great-recession.pdf) of the workforce. Especially when you consider the [studies](https://hbr.org/2012/03/a-study-in-leadership-women-do) that show women are often rated by their bosses, direct reports, and associates as better overall leaders than their male counterparts -- and the higher the level, the higher the ratings.\n\nSo why do women make up such a small proportion of leadership when their abilities compare favorably to those of men? \n\nWomen's civic engagement, like jury duty or military service, while welcomed, has been historically seen as non-essential. The old argument was, \"Women need to be protected,\" or, \"They have more important things to do, like raising children.\" As a country, we must do all we can to encourage women's participation and leadership in the public sector. \n\nWe need women--their participation, their management, their perspectives, and their communication--in every aspect of leadership, management, and government. \n\nIt is time we stop siloing women in [human resources and customer service](https://hbr.org/2012/04/gender-shouldnt-matter-but-app). Women excel in every arena when given the opportunity. The drive to prove one's ability pushes both women and men to succeed in nontraditional roles. We need to do all we can to break down the systemic barriers that create an environment where it's much tougher for women to succeed. \n\nThe first systemic barrier is money in politics. Right now we operate in a fundamentally anti-woman marketplace and that includes the marketplace for politicians. We need to establish public campaign financing because it encourages more [non-traditional, female, and minority candidates to run](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/more-combating-corruption-other-benefits-public-financing). We are already seeing this play out in Maine and Connecticut where women have been running in record numbers, bolstered by public financing. My Democracy Dollars plan will give every voter $100 that can only be donated to campaigns every cycle, and it will supercharge grassroots funding to make running for public office more accessible. \n\nBeyond promoting the representation of women in elected office, we must take decisive action to support those women who protect our country overseas. We cannot afford to damage our national security by minimizing female leadership in the military. [Diversity](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) in leadership, particularly gender diversity, allows for better dialogue and clearer decision-making among leaders. Increasing female leadership in the military is particularly important to maximize our national security readiness and develop stronger internal military policies of justly addressing instances of sexual harassment and assault. \n\nWomen have not only been historically excluded from top positions in the military, but also in the  government and private sector at large. We must focus on hiring, appointing, and selecting people based on their capabilities and skill sets, not on who has historically filled the role. President Obama used this philosophy in nominating Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, who had no prior experience as a judge. As the first female Dean of Harvard Law School and first female Solicitor General of the United States, Justice Kagan has brought incredible experience to the Court and is often noted as an expert in [building essential bridges](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/18/is-the-supreme-courts-fate-in-elena-kagans-hands) between the Court's conservative and liberal justices. \n\nWe also need to utilize the trickle-up economy to empower women in the workplace. A universal basic income of $1,000 a month will help empower women to lead. When women consider starting their own businesses, running for office, or pursuing new educational opportunities, finances are a paramount concern. A guaranteed revenue stream will give women the capital they need to break down barriers and pursue entrepreneurship, elected office, and higher education. As the Freedom Dividend works from the bottom up to elevate women into leadership roles, we must also work to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of roles open to them. \n\nWhile studies overwhelmingly show that businesses perform better when women are involved in leadership, female representation in leadership still remains low. To close this gap, I support laws modeled on legislation recently passed in California that require corporate boards of publicly traded companies to have at least one female member. This follows similar laws in [Italy, France, Belgium, and Norway](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/07/pf/gender-diversity-quotas/index.html), that have successfully increased the presence of women in the workplace.\n\nIncreased representation will lead to improved business outcomes. Today, women-owned businesses account for [39%](https://www.nawbo.org/resources/women-business-owner-statistics) of private businesses, yet they receive less than [5%](https://www.score.org/blog/how-women-entrepreneurs-can-win-federal-contracts) of federal contracts. To remedy this mismatch, the federal government can incentivize businesses to put women in leadership by requiring certain diversity standards for federal contracts and development grants. \n\nFinally, imbalanced career advancements and the gender pay gap is not just a women's issue, but it is particularly a mothers' issue. Companies that offer only maternal leave and not paternal leave feed into the stereotype that only women are the caretakers who should take a step back from their career when they have kids. This also makes women more expensive as employees, which disincentivizes employers from hiring women regardless of whether they intend to have children. Federally mandated gender-neutral paid family leave and guaranteed childcare will help to equalize career opportunities and advancement for women, particularly mothers, in the workplace. \n\nOur next President needs to recognize the need for increasing diversity in all levels of government and the private sector. I am committed to being that President. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Women are deeply underrepresented in leadership positions across the public and private sector.\n- Our government and private institutions lack gender-diverse leadership. \n- Our economy hampers the ability of women, particularly mothers, to advance their careers. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Gender diversity in government and the private sector\n- Enable men and women to access and pursue opportunities in every area independent of preconceptions\n- Ensure women have a seat at every table",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Provide every American voter with $100 Democracy Dollars for each election cycle, a voucher that they can use to support candidates of their choosing.\n- Commit to appointing women in top leadership positions in government and the military.\n- Prioritize the skills and capability over typical traditional experience for judicial nominees, thereby prioritizing women and minorities for the federal bench. \n- Implement a Freedom Dividend that empowers women to start businesses and further their education. \n- Explore legislation similar to the California law that promotes women on corporate boards. \n- Require certain diversity standards for federal contracts and development grants as a way to incentivize women in leadership. \n- Implement a gender-neutral paid family leave federal mandate."

            "In a perfect world, only those who are ready for and desire a child would become pregnant. But that's not the world we live in. One fact remains: everyone has a right to bodily integrity, and more needs to be done to ensure that women have and maintain that right in private.\n\nInaccessibility to abortion has serious economic consequences for women, particularly women with lower incomes. It [increases](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304247) their chances of experiencing poverty, unemployment, and dependence on public assistance programs. Low income women make up about [75%](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2014) of abortion patients, and women denied abortions are more likely to receive public assistance after childbirth than those who received an abortion. \n\nWhile denial of abortion rights hurts women economically, access to abortion has generational economic benefits. When we trust women to decide when to start a family, it dramatically [increases](https://iwpr.org/publications/economic-effects-abortion-access-fact-sheet/) their ability to graduate from college and start a career. They pass benefits on to their children, who are less likely to face poverty in childhood and more likely to go on to lead more educated and independent lives.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the landmark 1973 *Roe v. Wade* decision that protects a woman's right to choose, abortion laws look different from state to state. Without a federal law that confirms *Roe v. Wade,* which anchors a woman's right to an abortion on the fundamental right to privacy, states have extensive power to limit or expand access to abortion.\n\nNearly 20 years after *Roe v. Wade*, the *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* decision was passed permitting courts an undue burden standard that gave states the authority to regulate abortions before 24 weeks, as long as it doesn't place an \"undue burden\" on the woman. Since then, increased leniency to regulate abortion has given way to laws that make abortion almost impossible for women. They include [TRAP](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/targeted-regulation-abortion-providers) laws that require abortion service providers to maintain unnecessary licensing and hospital privileges, fetal heartbeat laws, and even a [bill](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/deadly-abortion-bans-endanger-pregnant-peoples-lives/) in Alabama that threatens doctors who perform abortions with severe criminal repercussions up to life in prison. These developments in restricting access to abortion are among many that have no basis in medical science and only exist to erode a woman's right to choose.\n\nThe [most](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304247) common reason women seek an abortion is a lack of means to financially support a child ([$233,610](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2018/02/26/raising-child-costs-233-610-you-financially-prepared-parent/357243002/) for the average middle income family before college expenses). Abortion itself is not cheap, which explains why affordability is one of the most significant barriers women encounter when seeking abortion care in the United States. The average amount paid for an early medication abortion is [$535](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2019/01/ensuring-access-abortion-state-level-selected-examples-and-lessons), and abortion costs increase as a pregnancy progresses. This price tag does not include other associated expenses, such as time off from work, child care, travel, and lodging, which particularly affect women who live in abortion clinic [deserts](https://www.ansirh.org/news/novel-study-identifies-27-large-us-cities-%E2%80%9Cabortion-deserts%E2%80%9D).\n\nThe Hyde Amendment bans federal funding for abortions other than to save a mother's life or to terminate a pregnancy that arises out of rape or incest. The means that family planning providers like Planned Parenthood can use federal funds to operate their facilities, so long as those funds for administering abortion come from other sources. Planned Parenthood is one of the many high-quality, client-centered family planning providers that offers affordable and comprehensive family planning and sexual health care to millions of Americans. Currently, U.S. taxpayers save [$7](https://thinkprogress.org/u-s-taxpayers-save-7-for-every-dollar-the-government-spends-on-family-planning-8eb5c609401f/) for every dollar the government spends on family planning funds by averting costly medical expenses. Unfortunately, funding for Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics that provide abortion referrals or abortion services is under attack by the [Title X Gag Rule](https://www.istandwithpp.org/no-gag-rule). \n\nA study of defunding Planned Parenthood by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the bill would reduce spending by [$520](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/24/defunding-planned-parenthood-would-actually-increase-government-spending/) million in the short run between 2016 and 2025, but subsequently increase direct spending on extra births and the ensuing children by $650 million during the same period. This legislation will cost American taxpayers more at the expense of American women's health. Both the Hyde Amendment and the Title X Gag Rule are cutting off critical preventative funding for family planning clinics like Planned Parenthood, and as a result, are costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\n\nThe truth is, restricting abortion does not reduce the number of abortions because these laws are usually passed in tandem with restricted access to contraception and inadequate sex education. Restricted abortion laws leads to more unplanned pregnancies and forces women to seek unsafe procedures that put them at risk. Unsafe abortions are the [third](https://youthsextion.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/2011facts-iaw.pdf) leading cause of maternal deaths worldwide and lead to an additional five million largely preventable disabilities. States with restrictive abortion laws, like Alabama, have some of the [highest](https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-anti-abortion-infant-mortality-20190515-story.html) infant mortality rates and some of the worst health outcomes for women in the nation compared to states like California that offer strongly protected abortion access. The closing of clinics and cutting funds to Planned Parenthood in 2012, caused maternal deaths in Texas to soar from [72](https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2016/08/MacDormanM.USMatMort.OBGYN_.2016.online.pdf) deaths per 100,000 live births to 148 deaths per 100,000 live births. Women should not have to risk their health and their lives when it can all be prevented through access to safe and legal abortion. \n\nThe [majority](https://www.ansirh.org/research/turnaway-study) of women who cannot afford or are denied abortion will carry the unwanted pregnancy to term. They have four times greater odds of living below the Federal Poverty Level, experience pregnancy complications, and experience barriers in their socioeconomic mobility. Children born to unwanted pregnancies also face a lifetime of underachievement and social distress, including a risk of becoming chronic juvenile delinquents [11](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9164769) times higher than other children. \n\nAbout [91%](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm) of abortions occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The second-trimester abortions are more complicated, whether that is due to delay in becoming aware, affordability barriers, or detection of anatomic or genetic anomalies. Yet, only 7.7% of abortions are performed at 14 to 20 weeks' gestation, and even fewer are performed at over 21 weeks' gestation (1.2%). The decision of abortion belongs to the woman, not the state or the federal government. Abortion is often painful and distressing, and women should be trusted when making this private, difficult decision. If and when they do make this sensitive decision, their reasons should be private and respected. \n\nDespite 32 state legislatures passing 394 new restrictions on abortion between 2011 and 2017, abortion rates fell across all states. Eighteen states that did not enact any new abortion restrictions accounted for [57%](https://patch.com/alabama/across-al/why-abortion-rates-are-down-alabama) of the decline in abortions nationwide. But the drop in abortion rates is not a result of more restrictive abortion laws. With birth rates down in nearly every state, the biggest reason for  the decline is that women are avoiding unintended pregnancies. By improving access to affordable sexual and reproductive health care that includes contraception, we are supporting patients' health and rights as a whole. \n\nWhen it comes to our laws regarding abortion, we need to trust women. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, \"Access to abortion is a woman's autonomous charge of her full life's course...her ability to stand in relation to man, society, and the state as an independent, self-sustaining, equal citizen.\" A woman's right to choose goes beyond autonomy, it is about equity, equality, and privacy. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Inaccessible abortion increases poverty among women and their families.\n- State variation on abortion laws impedes on women's right to choose. \n- Legislators with no medical background are eroding women's rights to have control over their own bodies. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Protect the right to privacy of a woman's right to choose\n- Treat women equally\n- Provide a federal standard for protecting a woman's right to choose",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Work with Congress to codify Roe v. Wade into law.\n- Appoint judges who support a woman's right to choose. \n- Ensure comprehensive contraceptive care is covered under all health insurance plans.\n- Repeal the Hyde Amendment.\n- Fully support and increase funding to Planned Parenthood. \n\n    - Repeal the Title X Gag Rule and the Global Gag Rule.

These strikes will only continue to grow as workers are waking up to the fact that they are working more and more for less and less. The American people are starting to notice, too. Today, union approval ratings are near [50](https://news.gallup.com/poll/265916/labor-day-turns-125-union-approval-near-year-high.aspx)-year highs.\n\nAs unions fight to get workers their fair share, the government is making that fight harder. State legislatures are stripping workers of key collective bargaining rights, which is pushing membership down, and last year the Supreme Court hampered unions' ability to fairly bargain.\n\nBy restricting organizing rights, we are moving our country in the wrong direction. We must align our policies to encourage the formation of unions and expand their negotiating power, so they can adequately represent workers and win fair contracts and protections with employers. Empowering unions will help working families and put pressure on employers to provide fair wages and benefits.\n\nWhile unions have fought tirelessly for over a century, another battle is upon us. The 4th Industrial Revolution stands to replace millions of union jobs with computer software and industrial robots. If union members and leaders aren't prepared, workers could be left without a voice during the biggest economic transformation in American history.\n\nIn Cedar Rapids, Iowa, General Mills workers fought and won key language that guarantees notice and leverage if the plant managers try to outsource their jobs. To prepare for the future, unions will have to fight for similar provisions as automation risks jeopardizing their member's livelihoods. With the right leverage, unions can guarantee their ability to negotiate fair benefits and settlements to help workers' transitions.\n\nThis fight will not be easy, and it will take working families who are willing to fight for the rights they deserve. We must protect workers' right to unionize and pass a Freedom Dividend of $1000 a month to act as a permanent strike fund. This will help workers strike longer and harder to win a seat at the table during the design and deployment of the technologies that are shaping the future of work.\n\n### **To read Andrew's entire Union plan, click [HERE](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/empowering-unions-in-the-21st-century-economy).** ",

Nearly 12 million Americans use these loans every year, serviced by 23,000 payday lenders in operation. But why are Americans willing to risk taking out loans with an average interest rate of [400%](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/states-with-the-highest-payday-loan-rates.html) and as high as 1,900%? While payday loans are marketed as a convenient, short-term solution to individuals who need cash immediately, it perpetuates an endless cycle of risky borrowing. Nearly 80% of borrowers have to re-borrow weeks after taking out their initial payday loan, in what is considered a debt trap. \n\nPayday loan companies [target](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2019/04/10/fast-cash-and-payday-loans) populations with higher-than-average poverty rates, lower income levels, lower education levels, and single-parents and minority groups. Over 30 million Americans are underbanked and unbanked, which means they have limited or no access to traditional banking services. They are forced to turn to [alternative](http://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/) financial services, such as payday loans. \n\nWe need to put strict safeguards in place to protect potential borrowers. The structure, unexpected fees, high interest rates, and the cycle of debt created by payday loans are reason for government intervention and strong financial regulation. As with all forms of credit, we must guarantee that borrowers have exhausted all available options before taking on a payday loan to avoid taking on debt they cannot afford. \n\nWe also need to eliminate the ability to borrow across state lines, and create minimum time frames that loans can be required to be paid back. \n\nI am committed to providing basic banking services through US post offices so underbanked or unbanked communities have better access to financial services. We should also explore enabling community centers, such as church groups, to provide microloans and set up credit unions. We need to provide better solutions to providing access to credit and mitigate the risk that individuals take out payday loans that can make them financially worse off than before. \n\nTackling the root causes of financial fragility that fuel the demand for payday loans is another step in the right direction. By implementing the Freedom Dividend, each American over 18 years old will receive $1,000 a month unconditionally, which will relieve financial anxiety and reduce the need to take out dangerous payday loans. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Payday loans are risky and under-regulated.\n- Many borrowers aren't aware of other borrowing options available to them.\n- Predatory lenders use payday loan to exploit those who need their paychecks most. ",

The people of Flint, Michigan, still have to drink from water bottles, polluted rivers in Iowa and tap water in South Carolina are linked to cancer, and lead has been found in the water of public schools in New Jersey. If we want to have any chance of fixing this situation, we need to be honest about it: our country is in the midst of a clean water crisis. \n\nIn 2015, 21 million Americans were getting their water from systems that violated health standards. The problem is particularly pronounced in rural and low-income communities that are home to large factories. Their water systems are absorbing tons of pollutants like nitrates and detergents, and there isn't a big enough tax base to pay for essential water treatment plants. \n\nOur infrastructure is falling into disrepair and we're dedicating less and less money to fix it. The EPA estimates that $384 billion will be needed to replace thousands of miles of pipes and water treatment plants and make other infrastructure improvements. The lack of investing this money hurts communities economically, especially those that rely on water tourism, by raising bills and bringing down real estate values. And, of course, it increases the long term costs of caring for a child who has been exposed to lead or other contaminants--not to mention the tragedy of causing this child and family suffering.\n\nWe must work with state and local governments along with our allies in the private sector to leverage the resources we need to tackle this problem together.\n\nBut we need to realize that this is more than an infrastructure or economic problem--this is a moral problem. As the parent of two young boys, I can't imagine having kids who have been drinking water for years and now knowing that their health might be damaged as a result. No American should have to worry about what's coming out of their tap. \n\nIt's time that America declares safe drinking water a fundamental right.

People with disabilities are much more likely to experience secondary complications that exacerbate their medical conditions and often need fast access to hospitals and treatment. Under the current system, these people disproportionately lack the access that they need because of high unemployment and homelessness rates, and higher rates of poverty. Additionally, there are issues with accessibility, both at healthcare provider locations and in transportation.\n\n[13.3](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaids-role-for-children-with-special-health-care-needs-a-look-at-eligibility-services-and-spending/) million children in the U.S. live with special healthcare needs. As the father of a son with autism, I understand the hardships millions of other American families face everyday. Children with disabilities need a wide range of medical and long-term services and support that our current healthcare system does not prioritize. Either not all medical services are covered, or they are only available in limited amounts through private insurance. \n\n47% of children with disabilities are covered by Medicaid or CHIP, another 49% are dependent on private insurance, and the remaining 4% have no insurance at all. That is 4% too many. Early detection, intervention, and on-going support is critical for parents of children with disabilities to understand and meet their child's needs. Our healthcare system should ensure all families have access to necessary experts and resources that equally uplift our children. \n\nWe need to ensure that all people, including children and persons with disabilities, have equal access to the healthcare they need.

We must teach healthy habits to young people and children. Eating an apple a day may not keep the doctor away, but it does promote healthy eating. Teaching kids the basics of a nutritious diet (and providing them healthy meals at school) and providing early screenings to identify flags like behavioral issues and different types of disabilities are key pieces in building towards positive outcomes. Tackling these issues early gives kids the best shot at leading a healthy life.\n\n[13.7 million](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/childhood.html) children and adolescents and 93.3 million adults in the U.S. are battling obesity.

Exercise for people of all ages has been recommended by physicians to prevent and help not only obesity, but also cardiovascular disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, many types of cancer, and depression. \n\nWe have seen a significant reduction in the use of combustible cigarettes and tobacco, but there is always room to improve. Nearly [38 million](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0118-smoking-rates-declining.html) American adults still smoke cigarettes every day and nearly 9 million vape, not including the recent [spike](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/youth-and-tobacco/2018-nyts-data-startling-rise-youth-e-cigarette-use) in the number of youth vaping.

Increasing Americans' buying power through the Freedom Dividend will create great new demand for healthy grocers to open stores in food deserts.

Food insecurity disproportionately affects households with children led by single women and people living below the poverty level.

We should invest in expanding existing technologies to reach those in underserved areas, especially the [77%](https://globalhealth.harvard.edu/blog/medical-deserts-america-why-we-need-advocate-rural-healthcare) of rural counties that are considered rural primary care deserts, 9% of which have no physicians at all. \n\nThe demand for physicians is outpacing the available supply, and the shortage is causing problems for the nation's growing and aging population. Telehealth is an effective approach for doctors across the country to provide care for patients in rural and underserved areas over the internet without needing a specific redundant license to practice medicine in the patient's state. Utilizing telehealth will enhance quality of life and reduce hospital visits, while curbing deaths from chronic diseases.\n\nPatients will be able to access treatment that may not be conveniently located. About 62% of rural counties are not equipped to provide services such as Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES). Numerous case studies have illustrated the benefits of telehealth for DSMES so far. For example, once a rural clinic in Montana implemented it, [61%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3208251/) of participants began monitoring their blood sugar accurately after just six months, an improvement from 31% pre-telehealth. The services have also shown positive results for mental health, stroke treatment, cardiac rehabilitation and cancer treatment. \n\nMedication abortion has similar efficacy of terminating early pregnancy as in-person abortions. Enlarging the geographical footprint of medical providers through telehealth can improve access to abortion in the [27](https://www.wired.com/story/telemedicine-makes-it-safe-to-get-abortion-drugs-in-the-mail/) US cities with populations greater than 50,000 people that have no abortion clinics within 100 miles. \n\nTelehealth is a cost-effective alternative to the more traditional face-to-face way of providing medical care and has the potential to save [billions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459384/) annually, while improving healthcare related to strokes, cardiac services, diabetes, and epilepsy. Ensuring healthcare for all also requires federal regulation of telehealth and expanding it in a way where we can distribute services and treatment.\n\nAs we continue to invest in medical innovation, we must integrate assistive technology into the primary care provided by doctors and nurses. Existing technologies like telehealth and emerging technology like medical AI must be leveraged to expand care. Working together through telemedicine, teams of nurses, AI, and doctors will be able to provide care to thousands of Americans that currently have limited access to healthcare.\n\nAs this technology advances, we need to trust in our nurses and nurse practitioners to provide care that's historically the responsibility of MDs. This will be essential in providing access to care across rural areas and can even be supervised by a doctor through a telehealth system. This new system, combining the best of AI, telehealth, and professional expertise will allow for a more flexible and responsive health force without sacrificing quality of care.\n\nHuman anatomy doesn't change across state lines, but doctors are still required to obtain medical licenses for each state they practice in. These onerous relicensing requirements discourage qualified doctors from providing essential care through telemedicine to those in other states. We must streamline the licensing system and introduce a single, comprehensive telemedicine license that, once granted, will allow care providers to see patients in all 50 states. Federal regulation of medical licensing will remove this friction and encourage doctors to start practicing telemedicine and make inroads into primary care deserts. ",

            "Strict voter identification requirements across the country are depriving many voters of their right to vote. Of course, the lawmakers who write these laws and voters who use their identification in their everyday lives don't think this is a big deal. However, low-income households, the elderly, transgender individuals, minorities, and people with disabilities (PWD) are more likely to be disenfranchised by these laws because they are more likely to experience difficulty obtaining the underlying documents necessary. [3.6%](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/02/19/do-voter-id-laws-reduce-turnout-among-black-americans) of registered white voters lacked proper ID, compared to 7.5% of black registrants. The transgender community is disproportionately affected by these laws. [57%](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/voter-id-laws-2018/) (approximately 78,000) of transgender people may not have identification or documentation that accurately reflects their gender, making them ineligible to vote.\n\nProcesses to change names or gender markers on identification can be expensive, difficult, and vary from state to state. For individuals who do not have traditional identification like a driver's license or passport, states are legally required to provide a process for them to obtain some form of voter ID. However, states can purposely make it difficult to obtain voter ID by severely limiting the days that their ID offices are open. The most extreme example includes a location in Sauk County, Wisconsin where the office is only open on the [fifth Wednesday of every month](https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/11/01/wisconsins-voter-id-controversy-what-you-need-to-know/) (which equates to four days of the entire year). \n\nNationally, [25%](https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/jul/11/eric-holder/eric-holder-says-recent-studies-show-25-percent-af/) of African-American voting-age citizens lack a government-issued photo ID, compared to 8% of White voting-age citizens. The income gap plays major role in explaining this difference. Obtaining a government issued ID can easily cost $75 to $175 in transport fees, waiting times, and paying for supporting papers like birth certificates, which are not as easily accessible to minority communities living in poverty. When states enact voter ID laws, their turnout decreases by [2-3%](https://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665966.pdf) and primarily affects ages 18-23, new voters, and African-American voters. \n\nMore than [three-quarters](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/health/voting-eligibility-elderly.html) of older voters between the ages of 65 and 74 are registered to vote, and more than 60% of those aged 85 and above cast a ballot in the 2016 election. Despite large voter turnout of the elderly population, who take their civic duty seriously, stringent identification laws are making it more and more difficult for them to participate in the voting process. Whether that means finding transportation to renew their expired driver's license or scrambling to find a birth certificate that was issued 80 years ago, older voters are also becoming targets of disenfranchisement. \n\nIdentification problems should not bar Americans from voting. We must remove discriminatory voter ID laws that deny thousands of otherwise eligible citizens the opportunity to participate in the democratic process. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Voter ID laws prevent eligible voters from exercising their rights but do nothing to make our elections safer. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Raise voter turnout\n- Ensure that Americans who don't have access to photo ID's are still able to exercise their democratic rights",

            "Many Americans are taking time off from work to vote, only to experience absurd lines, understaffed polling stations, and hassles with voter ID requirements. Mail-in ballots and early voting not only help the working-class American, but also those who are unable to make it to a polling station, including but not limited to the ill, physically disabled, or those working poll stations. \n\n[Two-thirds](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx) of states now offer some form of early voting, giving Americans the ability to cast their ballots at less crowded polling stations and with reduced wait times. This provides significant relief to poll workers and increases voter turnout, especially of underrepresented populations. \n\n[Thirty states ](https://www.nycbar.org/pdf/report/uploads/20071936-NoExcuseAbsenteeBallotReport.pdf)have enacted no-excuse absentee voting, which allows citizens to submit their votes by mail at designated polling locations. This allows states to save millions of dollars because they don't need to establish polling places or pay polling staff, and it increases voter turnout of younger, older, poorer, and minority voters. \n\nUnfortunately, onerous matching requirements of names or signatures have led to the rejection of thousands of legitimate votes. Legal, financial, and societal barriers do not always make legal name changes easy. These requirements create barriers to people with disabilities, women who have married or divorced, and transgender people. In Florida, over [5,000 vote by mail ballots were rejected](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/voting-signatures-matching-elections.html) for signature requirements. In Georgia's gubernatorial race, [hundreds of absentee ballots were rejected](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2018-10-24/judge-no-rejecting-mail-ballots-due-to-signature-mismatch) without first giving voters a chance to fix the problem because of suspected signature mismatches. Young voters are also [more likely](https://www.aclufl.org/en/publications/vote-mail-ballots-cast-florida) to have their mail-in ballots rejected because they did not use their handwriting enough to develop a steady signature.\n\nEarly voting and mail-in ballots contribute to the convenience and participation of citizens in the democratic process. We need to extend these opportunities to all Americans and do away with restrictions, like name and signature matching requirements, that work against it. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Working Americans are forced to take time off to vote.\n- Polling stations are often crowded and have long lines.\n- Thousands of valid votes are thrown out due to onerous signature matching requirements. ",

            "## As President I will...\n\n- Implement a federal law that requires all states to integrate voting by early voting and mail-in ballots to their voting process.\n- Require states to eliminate onerous name and signature matching requirements that lead to the rejection of legitimate votes without giving voters the opportunity to fix these issues.

            "For decades, our voting system has disenfranchised and discriminated against Native Americans and Alaska Natives. [Restrictive laws](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/state-native-american-voting-rights) that require traditional street addresses and voter ID laws that do not accept tribal identification make voting registration difficult for Native Americans. Limited polling sites and resources require that Native Americans travel great distances to vote, sometimes up to 150 miles.\n\nThe federal government can do much more to establish greater support for Native American voting rights. As part of establishing laws to combat voter suppression tactics like voter ID laws and limited polling locations, we need to pass legislation like the [Native American Voting Rights Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1694/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.+R.+83%22%5D%7D&r=62&s=1) that carves out specific provisions that address Native American and Alaska Native voting issues. These specifics need to include requiring polling stations to be located near tribal reservations, states to accept tribal ID cards for voting purposes, and alternative address options for those who reside on tribal reservations.\n\nNative Americans aren't the only population impacted by a lack of polling stations. Since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act, polling stations have been vanishing, especially in locations with high populations of minorities. In a city in Alabama, council members [eliminated 60% of the polling locations](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/07/11/453319/increasing-voter-participation-america/) within the nearby African American district, but left open 100% of the polls in the white-majority districts. Fewer polling stations [substantially decreases](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41480830?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) voter turnout, and drastically increases long lines at the polling stations. In addition, last-minute changes to polling stations force voters to figure out where their new polling stations are and rearrange their transportation plans or schedules accordingly. These abrupt changes limit access to polling stations and deter Americans from showing up. ",

            "Like the rest of America's infrastructure, voting is chronically underfunded. This leaves our democracy open to attack. My administration will fund the development and rollout of new, more secure machines that aren't open to attack.\n\nThis threat is not hypothetical. In the recent past, internet-connected machines have been [hacked](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~davide/voting-machines/) and used to print out fraudulent ballots. Additionally, [Russia ](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russians-hacked-two-u-s-voter-databases-say-officials-n639551)was able to hack into voter databases in across the US. Ballot security is national security, and we must ensure that Russia and others who wish to do us harm do not have an open door into the machinery of democracy. To prevent successful attacks, new machines should be disconnected from the internet.\n\nBeyond removing our machines from the internet, we will build a system in which every vote leaves a paper trail. Paper backups are critical in cases of hardware failure and guarantee that a vote won't be lost on account of a software bug. Additionally, paper provides a record of the vote that can't be hacked or easily altered. Optical scanners that read paper ballots and store them electronically are a great way to combine the security of paper with the ease of technology.\n\nNo matter how safe and effective voting machines are, they won't have any effect unless voters have access to them. Voting security cannot only be practiced by the federal government, it must happen at every level. To connect voters with secure, well-maintained machines and functioning polling stations, the federal government must give states the resources they need to procure and install this technology at every voting station. We must also fund more post-election audits to detect any attempts to interfere in the democratic process.\n\nDespite the [$380 million](https://www.eac.gov/news/2018/03/29/us-election-assistance-commission-to-administer-380-million-in-2018-hava-election-security-funds/) round of grants given to states last year by the federal Elections Assistance Commission, states need much more to cover all the costs that voting security demands. For example, to replace all electronic paperless voting machines in Pennsylvania, it is estimated they will need [$50.4 to $79.1 million](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/federal-funds-election-security-will-they-cover-costs-voter-marked-paper-ballots) statewide, far more than the $13.5 million provided by Congress. My administration will make it clear in Pennsylvania and every other state that money isn't an obstacle to a secure democracy.\n\nSafe elections require more than responsible machines, they require responsible humans. My administration will work with states and voting staff to guarantee they are trained in best cybersecurity practices, including threat detection and reporting. By bringing together the best that humans and technology have to offer, we can ensure every American has access to a secure ballot box.\n\nAs we focus on the elections of today, we must not fail to prepare for those of tomorrow. The threat of cyber attacks is always growing and evolving, so we must keep up to date on every development to maintain secure election infrastructure.\n\nLooking to the future of voting, we must consider what options we have to make voting more secure and accessible. My administration will research developments in e-voting, including mobile voting. If this technology proves truly secure and viable, its use would dramatically boost voter and reduce the costs of local, state and national elections. We will also invest in the cyber security apparatus as a whole to not only keep our voting infrastructure safe, but also defend our power grid, defense sector, and government from hackers. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Our voting system is vulnerable to hackers and software failure.\n- Americans no longer trust the security of our democracy.\n- States don't have the resources to protect their elections. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Protect our democracy from cyber attacks\n- Restore Americans' faith in the democratic process\n- Make elections in every state reliable and secure",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Increase federal funding toward ballot box security so voting machines cannot be hacked and have a paper trail for mandatory audits.\n- Increase federal funding so all states have the money they need for secure voting machines, maintenance, and staffing polling locations.\n- Invest in cybersecurity research for the future.\n- Research modern e-voting practices that guarantee security."

As the father of two young boys, I worry about what this will mean for the generations growing up with these technologies. Our kids have access from infancy. They're getting glued on apps and devices that are functioning as dopamine slot machines.\n\nI look back at my childhood and I remember riding a bike around the neighborhood, but now tablets, computers, and mobile devices have shifted the attention of youth. Today, [more than half](https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/digital-guidelines) of children aged 8-12 have their own tablet and a quarter of them have their own smartphone. \n\nThe effects are worrying. There has been an unprecedented surge in depression, anxiety, and suicide, and a marked decrease in sociability. Teenagers are spending more time worrying about whether their online acquaintances like their recent post than spending time with their friends in person and developing social skills. The average teenager spends Friday nights at home, interacting with a machine, instead of out with friends.\n\nEven the content for children on these platforms isn't subject to any rules and standards the way they are on TV. This lack of regulation means that our children are exposed to extreme and inappropriate content at younger and younger ages.\n\nIt's also causing other risks to health. [Studies](http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=EDU/WKP%282019%293&docLanguage=En) have found adverse associations between screen time and sleep deprivation. Extended screen time has also been linked with obesity in children. The health of our kids, and potentially of generations after, are at risk. We must take action.\n\nThose who have worked within the industry describe the work they've done in stark terms. They say that the smartest minds of a generation are spending their time getting teenagers to click on ads and obsess over social media posts.\n\nIn short, many experts are worrying that the widespread adoption of a poorly understood technology has caused mental health and developmental problems for an entire generation.

Since regulating online gaming in 2013, New Jersey alone has taken in about $250 million in taxes, about 10% of which come from online poker.\n\nThe potential size of a federally regulated US online poker market is significant, with reports estimating $2.2 billion just in the first year.\n\nNot only would federal licensing, regulation, and taxation of online poker make sense from a revenue perspective, but it would ensure a more secure environment to play in, limit the influence of offshore unregulated platforms, and make it easier to combat money laundering. \n\nThe online poker laws today make offshore sites the only option for many American players. Since foreign companies and sites cannot be regulated or monitored, these players are more vulnerable to exploitation and greater financial risk.\n\nThe current state-by-state rules are variable and push many players to these potentially unsafe offshore sites. Clarifying the rules and making it legal in all 50 states and territories would benefit American players and companies, while new tax revenues can be used to mitigate gambling addiction.\n\nIn 2016, only $73 million in state and federal funds were dedicated to gambling addiction services, despite an estimated 5.4 million Americans battling it. Twenty percent of states don't dedicate any funds toward gambling addiction at all. It needs to be taken more seriously. We should be dedicating adequate resources towards research to analyzing the extent of the problem, treatment programs, and prevention awareness campaigns.\n\nThe pendulum has swung back and forth during the debate of online poker regulation over the past decade as archaic laws such as the Interstate Wire Act of 1961 are applied and contrasting summary judgments are passed by courts on the application of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) of 2006. Yet, despite the bans no poker players have ever been criminally charged.\n\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada came close on a couple of occasions to passing legislation, and I would look to the elements in his proposed Internet Poker Act of 2010 as a starting point without concern for powerful casino lobbyists who try to thwart such efforts.\n\nThis is a no-brainer and ultimately gives Americans the freedom to choose to play poker in a casino or from the comfort of their homes. It's already happening - US online poker sites report customers from all 50 states. History is littered with examples of the government trying to kneecap industries that will always find ways to exist, until finally coming around and realizing the benefits of regulating them.

The filibuster is nothing more than a legislative quirk that has been weaponized by both sides to prevent congress from voting on legislation and presidential appointees.\n\nThe filibuster was created by accident, and it was hardly used for the majority of this country's history. The modern filibuster was only created in 1917, and it wasn't until a rules change in the '70s that allowed for a silent filibuster that it began to fall into common use, at which point the problem of filibuster abuse quickly grew out of control.\n\nThe use of the filibuster to block judicial nominees was weaponized by Mitch McConnell. In the history of the United States, 68 nominees were blocked by the legislative tool. McConnell used it to block 79 of Obama's nominees in his first term. Since then, both sides have played legislative games with the filibuster, changing it as necessary to suit their judicial agenda.\n\nAt this point, it's the case that any major legislation requires 60 votes to pass. This has stymied the ability of the Senate to get anything done, and it prevents legislation from even being raised, with the knowledge that there's no way it will ever pass. Additionally, it protects Senators from having to take hard votes, as close bills won't even be brought up to the floor.\n\nIn short, because of the structure of the Senate and its current leader - Mitch McConnell - it's unlikely that we will be able to enact bold solutions without moving from our current, broken system. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Congress is unable to bring important legislation or nominees to a vote.\n- Our Congress has slowed to a crawl. ",

            "## As President I will...\n\n- Get rid of the filibuster or Mitch McConnell (or, preferably, both). Promote an end to the current filibuster system used in the Senate, ending the requirement for a 60-vote cloture motion and replacing it with the traditional need to hold the floor.\n\n    - This will promote the actual articulation of an argument against the legislation or appointment opposed.\n- Accept a phase-in period so that the Senate that implements the majority requirement isn't the Senate that first operates under the new rules."

            "The American people need to know that the President isn't setting policy for their own financial benefit. The Office conveys unbelievable power to influence actions of governments and individuals around the world, and it would be very easy for an unprincipled person to get rich from the office.\n\nWe need to ensure that there is enough financial transparency in the federal government for Americans to trust that the decisions being made by the President and senior members of the Administration are solely to advance the best interests of Americans, and not themselves and their family.\n\nOutside of directly benefiting from their position in government, the federal government has also become a revolving door. Individuals move back and forth between high-paying industry jobs and positions at government agencies that regulate those industries. People can see the influence of corporate America in the legislation being passed, and it causes them to feel like the government is built around defending the interests of the rich, not normal Americans.\n\nThe Office of the President is admired throughout American society. However, that respect has been capitalized on by recent presidents for personal gain. Six-digit speaking fees and lucrative board positions fuel the perception that the President may go soft on people that he or she could receive fees from after leaving office.\n\nTo combat this, we should raise the salaries of the President, cabinet members, and heads of regulatory agencies while barring anyone serving in these offices from accepting speaking fees or lucrative board positions for personal gain after leaving office, for at least a decade, if not longer. ",

Yes, this is a bit boring, but the current structure doesn't allow for proper enforcement against current abuses of the system. If the agency tasked with ensuring fair elections doesn't work, the American people won't believe that the elections are fair (and when the FEC only has 3 members, it is unable to hold a quorum or even vote on whether it should enforce any campaign regulations).\n\nCurrently, the FEC is made up of 6 members, no more than 3 of whom are from the same political party. The President typically appoints 3 Democrats and 3 Republicans, recommended by the Congressional leadership. It's not shocking that this leads to polarization and gridlock. Through meaningful legislation, we need to give the FEC more specific regulations on how Super PACs must effectively disclose where all of its money comes from. [The Brennan Center has done great work on developing a plan](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/fixing-fec-agenda-reform). ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- An equal number of seats in the FEC has resulted in consistent deadlock.\n- FEC is currently not enforcing or regulating campaign finance laws due to deadlock. \n- Current members of Congress who benefit from a deadlock FEC have no incentive to appoint members that would help the FC become an effective agency. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Create an odd number of seats on the FEC to avoid deadlock decisions\n- Restore the FEC to actually enforce the campaign finance laws it is intended to regulate\n- Incentivize Congress to appointment FEC members who will actually enforce campaign finance regulations",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Break with tradition and appoint nonpartisan members to the FEC (retired judges, academics, etc), instead of appointing the Congressional leaders' partisan picks.\n- Propose legislation that would limit the FEC to 5 members, with no more than 2 members from one political party. Additionally, the chair will be required to be nonpartisan and will be chosen with the assistance of a blue-ribbon advisory panel. Only if Congress approves of this legislation will I return to the tradition of appointing their partisan picks for the other 4 FEC members.\n- Direct the FEC to focus on increasing disclosure requirements, and focusing on unearthing the donor trail, for Super PACs."

            "We need to leave all options on the table to combat climate change. That includes geoengineering - methods to reverse the damage that we've already done to the environment. These techniques don't work as a replacement to moving to renewable energy, but we should investigate geoengineering in case we can't change our behaviors fast enough to ward off the worst of climate change.\n\nIn general, geoengineering methods fall into two categories (though there are ideas that don't fit into either one): \n\n1) Carbon dioxide removal - techniques that remove the amount of carbon dioxide in the air.\n\n2) Solar radiation management - techniques that decrease the amount of sunlight that hits the atmosphere or reflects more of it back into space. \n\nCertain geoengineering options are easy to reverse, or benign enough that we can feel safe deploying them without much further testing. For example, planting millions of new trees would store large amounts of carbon. Ethiopia recently planted 350 million new trees, and more countries can engage in similar projects. We should also engage in ocean afforestation, seeding the oceans with microalgae.\n\nAdditional carbon capture technologies can help us to remove a lot of the carbon from the air, a process that we know is safe because trees have been doing it for longer than humans have existed. Not only that, but scientists largely agree that technologies in this area must be a part of any climate program.\n\nDifferent organizations are researching the use of carbon capture to create building materials, carbon-neutral fuels (e.g., BECCS), and even ethanol. The federal government should encourage this research while still ensuring certain safety guidelines. We can also use this captured carbon to improve our soil (e.g., biochar). We can also take smaller steps, like packing gravel against the bases of glaciers to slow down their melting.\n\nWhile carbon capture solutions are important to investigate and can bend the curve to give us more time or serve as a partial solution to the climate crisis, we should also prepare for the worst. There are feedback loops that we don't understand that could quickly lead to a catastrophic event. If it comes to that, we need to be prepared with options like solar radiation management that have potential side effects that are more desirable than the alternative: climate collapse.\n\nThe safest forms of solar radiation management include a technique of spraying salt water into clouds makes them larger and brighter, which will reflect more sunlight into space. There are also more extreme options of solar radiation management that include space mirrors (yes, space mirrors) and stratospheric aerosol scattering.\n\nSpace mirrors would involve launching giant foldable mirrors into space that would deploy and reflect much of the sun's light. This method would be extremely expensive, which is why it should be investigated as a last resort. However, since we would be able to \"undo\" the mirror after deployment if needed, it's less permanent.\n\nStratosphere aerosol scattering, on the other, would be a drastic response to the climate crisis. When volcanoes erupt, they spew sulfur dioxide into the sky and reflect sunlight particles away from the earth. The massive eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 was recorded to help push global temperatures down half a degree over the following 2 years. If scientists can find a way to burn sulfur in the stratosphere, then they could mimic the positive effects of volcanoes eruptions on climate change and their ability to help keep the earth cool.  Bill Gates has recently backed a study to explore the feasibility of this method, but there are many dangers to it, which is why it (and other, similar methods) require research.\n\nIf we don't start experimenting with these methods, then someone else will. Let's be a world leader in geoengineering so that we can ensure it's safe and scalable, and that we're in charge of deploying it, should the need arise. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- As the climate continues to change, reaching net-zero emissions will not be enough to prevent catastrophic effects on our environment.\n- We do not currently have the technology or ability in place to reverse climate change. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Develop backup plans for combating climate change if net-zero emissions proves to not be enough\n- Consider and investigate all possible options to reverse climate change to ensure we are ready to employ these methods if they become necessary",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Provide $800 million to NASA, the Department of Defense, and NOAA to research, experiment with, and test geoengineering methods that will either give us more time to deal with climate change, or give us options should we hit a climate tipping point of which we aren't aware.\n- Convene a global summit on geoengineering. Many researchers in the US and other countries are doing work in this field - if we bring them together we can formalize and accelerate our learning and build a global approach. "

            "The severity of hurricanes has increased significantly in the past decade compared to trends of the previous century. Even if we manage to cut our global emissions enough to curtail severe climate change, studies predict that we are likely to see more than a 50% increase in category 4 and 5 hurricanes in the 21st century. \n\nThese hurricanes will continue to cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage.\n\nWe must take steps toward permanent adaptation to this changing climate to minimize the repeated cycle of these hurricanes causing untold suffering and billions of dollars in damage, only to see these communities be rebuilt to be hit by another hurricane. \n\nWe must invest in innovative solutions for rebuilding our communities that reside in high risk flood and hurricane zones. We can turn to countries like the Netherlands, who invested $500 million over 6 years (compare this to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans which lost $161 billion in a matter of days) to build a massive flood gate that permanently protects all of the Dutch homes that reside below sea level. \n\nWe can also look closer to home, at Hoboken, New Jersey. After Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012, the city initiated a major storm resiliency effort to rebuild its parks, sewer systems, pipes, and gardens to withstand massive floods. Hoboken lost over $1 billion in Hurricane Sandy. As a result, it is spending $140 million alongside $230 million in federal aid to rebuild its city in a way that will prevent it from losing the same amount in future inevitable disasters.\n\nConcurrently, we must reevaluate FEMA's policies, and our National Flood Insurance Plan.\n\nFEMA's out-of date flood zone map needs to be updated to reflect the true 41 million homes that are at high risk for catastrophic flooding (not the 13 million it currently states). The Agency's prevention policy in response to floods and hurricanes is to rebuild homes and buildings that are \"more resistant to flood damage.\" FEMA does not currently have a policy that prevents them from rebuilding homes located in high risk areas. As a result, several homes have received more federal aid to rebuild their homes than what the home is actually worth. For example, the same home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has been rebuilt 40 times, costing the government $428,379 even though the home is only worth $55,921.\n\nOur National Flood Insurance Plan was designed to force the purchase of flood insurance for high-risk areas, thus increasing the cost of living there and causing people to move to safer areas. Unfortunately, people have continued for 50 years to live, build, and rebuild their homes in high risk flood zones. As a result, private insurance companies are in a position to make money when major natural disasters hit, leaving the NFIP over $25 billion in debt. \n\nOur federal agencies and plans that are designed to help those who are affected by hurricanes and floods must take a stricter line on rebuilding in areas that are likely to be damaged again. These organizations should absolutely help people after a natural disaster, but they should also ensure that we're not throwing good money after bad, and relocate people as needed after disasters to ensure that they don't end up in the same position again. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- The Federal government is wasting billions of dollars rebuilding homes and buildings that are at high risk of being destroyed by flooding.\n- FEMA's natural disaster response practices do not take enough preventive measures for future likely disasters. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Invest millions of dollars in flood prevention efforts that will save us billions of dollars in damages long-term\n- Save taxpayer dollars by developing natural disaster practices that are more preventative than responsive",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Invest $25 billion over 10 years in helping communities that are likely to be impacted by repeated hurricane and flood damage to make their communities more disaster-resistant through pre-disaster mitigation grants.\n- Reevaluate the way FEMA and the NFIP determine where structures can be rebuilt, taking a stricter stance against rebuilding in danger zones."

            "Moving to renewable energy for personal use is important. It makes the home healthier. It lowers energy costs. It also requires a large up-front investment.\n\nWhen the US wanted to ensure that everyone could own a home, we started Fannie Mae. When we wanted to make college more affordable, we created Pell grants.\n\nIn order to ensure that everyone can afford the investment to upgrade their houses with solar panels, weatherproofing, heat pumps, and other technologies, we need to implement similar programs. With the right financing, people can afford the upfront costs, lower their energy costs, and end up coming out ahead. By setting interest rates low enough, we can get most households to upgrade their electricity to renewables while keeping more of their money. \n\nThe scale of the work that we're going to need to embark on is staggering and exciting. The last time we dedicated the American people to a massive manufacturing project - World War II - we grew our economy, kicked off decades of growth, and created a set of middle class jobs that provided upward mobility and a good life for half a century.\n\nAs Saul Griffith, the founder of Otherlab, puts it:\n\n*\"We need to manufacture electric heat pumps for 120 million American homes and 6 million commercial buildings. We need to manufacture 200+ million electric vehicles. We need 90 million solar rooftops, tens of millions of wind turbines, and billions of batteries, not to mention new biofuel industries, new farming methods and technologies, and new approaches to forestry.\"*\n\nAnd while many of these manufacturing jobs will be automated, the installation and maintenance of these systems will create good, middle-class, local jobs that will keep individuals employed for decades to come. We'll need to establish vocational and apprenticeship programs that will train American workers to install, maintain, and repair these systems, and then ensure that all Americans who so choose can receive this training, including through programs in high school.\n\nIt total, my plan calls for $4.87 trillion spending over 20 years. More than half of that spending. $3 trillion, will be given out in the form of loans that will be repaid at an interest rate of 3%. The other $1.87 trillion will go towards investments in new green technologies that will create a demand for millions of new American jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. ",

            "Building, rebuilding, and restoration of buildings and infrastructure will always create a constant need for construction. We need to establish sustainable practices for both the construction and operation of buildings and infrastructure.\n\nWe need to set sustainable infrastructure and electricity standards for all new buildings, and base any infrastructure spending on meeting these standards. All federal buildings should also be \"upgraded\" to meet these standards. With the size of the federal government, a commitment to buying American efficiency and sustainability products will create massive demand that American entrepreneurs and businesses will be happy to fill.\n\nSpeaking of construction, humans make a lot of cement. A lot of it. Concrete is quite literally what the modern world is built on. Around 10 billion tons of concrete are made each year, and the process is very energy-intensive.\n\nConcrete does naturally absorb carbon dioxide, but that's a slow process, and it doesn't fully balance out the amount released in its manufacture. As more of the world develops, we'll need more concrete. We should invest in research to see if we can increase the absorption rate of carbon dioxide, or even find ways to capture carbon and turn it into concrete or a concrete substitute. The scale of concrete manufacturing makes it an ideal material to focus on, but we should also research other materials that can be used for a variety of functions that can help us combat climate change.\n\nFinally, planning for a sustainable economy isn't just about addressing current manufacturing and electricity needs. It's also about addressing the electricity needs of the future. One of the largest areas of growth in this regard is computing and data storage.\n\nThe world is using hundreds of terawatts of energy for data storage, and the US makes up a substantial portion of that. This energy consumption is also set to double every few years. We need to stay ahead of this problem as we generate and store more data.\n\nThe government needs to fund research into solutions for this problem, from increased efficiency, to better and smarter cooling solutions, to storing data in space (where temperatures and vacuum make storage more energy efficient, and solar energy is plentiful).

            "Agriculture makes up nearly $1 trillion of the US economy, and our natural lands are a natural treasure. Both also are impacted by climate change, can be a driver of climate change, and need to be a part of the solution to the climate crisis we're facing. Local climates are changing, natural disasters - especially floods, droughts, and wildfires - are becoming more frequent, and our soil is becoming depleted.\n\nThe government needs to ensure that farms that experiment with new, more sustainable techniques have the money they need to test these techniques and still be protected in case it decreases yields. We also need to invest in alternatives to traditional farming, such as vertical farming techniques. And we need to research drought-resistant crops, along with other types of crops that can withstand the challenges of climate change. The federal government can also work with states to determine what crops are most sustainable in their areas, and track changes as climate change shifts the local climate.\n\nThe federal government has given nearly $400 billion in farming subsidies since 1995. Subsidies help protect our food supply from \"bad years\" of extreme and unpredictable weather. Adjusting our agricultural system to adapt with climate change is a good example of why farming subsidies were created in the first place. A portion of planned farming subsidies over the next 15 years should be redirected specifically toward sustainable techniques and exploration of alternative farming methods. \n\nTo make better use of our land, the Department of Agriculture should investigate the best grazing and livestock land management techniques, and provide reports to states and private enterprises on them. We need to identify land where we can plant more trees, and also take an active hand and expend the resources needed to rejuvenate our high-carbon ecosystems, such as peatlands, wetlands, rangelands, and mangroves.\n\nWe can also decrease the stress on our farmlands by decreasing food waste. Supermarkets can receive tax incentives to waste less food. This can be done through encouraging the donation of food. It can also be done by encouraging better inventory management - instead of overstocking, supermarkets can be encouraged to understock, with differences being made up through tax credits. They should also be sourcing more local foods, and incentives can be made to label all produce with where it's from.\n\nFinally, we need to make better use of organic waste, both from livestock and from trash. Biogas - a type of biofuel that is generated by the decomposition of organic material - can generate a large amount of electricity from what would otherwise be a giant source of methane and carbon dioxide. The EESI estimates that we can add over 10,000 new biogas systems, which would generate electricity, reduce emissions, and save municipalities a lot of money on both transporting waste and maintaining landfills. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Climate change is going to negatively impact our lands and our food source.\n- Many current farming practices emit methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Develop sustainable farming techniques\n- Use farming subsidies to assist our agricultural system to adapt to climate change",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Provide grants and guarantee profitability for farms that experiment with new, sustainable techniques.\n- Increase farm bill subsidies by $75 billion over the next 15 years for farms that experiment with new, sustainable techniques.\n- Invest $2 billion in research for vertical farming techniques.\n- Direct the Department of Agriculture to provide reports to states and private enterprises to help them improve their grazing and livestock land management.\n- Work with states to determine sustainable crops for their areas, and suggest changes as climate change continues to advance.\n- Increase funding to biogas programs by tripling the current annual mandatory funding for biogas to $200 million. \n- Authorize a $500 million increase to federal agencies tasked with maintaining land to increase afforestation while rejuvenating high-carbon ecosystems such as peatlands, wetlands, rangelands, and mangroves.\n- Invest in research for drought-resistant crops.\n- Provide $300 million in tax credits to incentivize supermarkets to waste less food, either through donations or inventory management changes, and to source more local food."

            "Americans want their kids to breathe clean air and drink clean water. They want to leave a healthy planet for their children. Residential and commercial energy consumption accounts for somewhere around 50% of emissions. We can't move to a sustainable economy without getting our energy from renewable sources.\n\nTackling our energy supply is the biggest move we need to make in order to create a sustainable economy. It is impossible to know right now which renewable energy technologies are going to be the most efficient options in 10 or 20 years. The goal of having a renewable energy plan is to have a starting point of where we will invest our time and research. First and foremost, it is important for our government to be able to adjust its plans as technology and more efficient solutions develop.\n\nThe government needs to dedicate itself to a massive investment in new technologies and a promise to purchase American-made efficiency and renewable energy technologies. We must plan all infrastructure projects to include environmentally friendly materials and be powered by renewable energy, and we should incentivize corporations to do the same with their businesses. \n\nUnder the EPA's mandate to regulate carbon, we need to increase our Clean Power Plan targets to make our electricity sector sustainable, and force all power plants to meet these standards.\n\nMany communities - especially rural electric cooperatives - are currently using power from coal plants on which they owe billions of dollars. These communities want to shift their energy sources to renewables, but they can't afford to pay off their current debt - which is estimated to be at least $8.4 billion - on the old plants and build new ones, especially as the relative cost of coal increases (and will continue to as we end subsidies). The US government can forgive the debt for those co-ops that are looking to make a transition to renewable energy, and provide different financing options to these cooperatives to get them to move over to renewable sources.\n\nSince these technologies are advanced but still developing, it'll be important for the government to also work with the companies innovating in these areas to create certain standards that will allow for interchangeability and upgrading. No one wants their electric vehicle to only be able to charge at certain stations because it uses a different standard. ",

Different models would be considered and funded, without the organization itself proscribing any particular structure. Funding through this organization would require sharing all data, and patents generated would face forced licensing so that others could build off of the successes.\n\nAdditionally, the extreme effects of climate change - including, but not limited to increased hurricanes, wildfires, precipitation, droughts, heavy downpours, heat waves, mudslides, tornadoes, avalanches, and more - will continue to be unpredictable for years to come.

            "Transportation contributes to 29% of all US greenhouse gas emissions. We need to eliminate our transportation emissions by converting our modes of transportation to clean and renewable energy by 2040. The government needs to set aggressive standards for ground vehicles, aircrafts, and public transportation.\n\nFirst, vehicles on the ground need to hit zero-emissions by 2040. The standard for all car models from 2030 on should be zero-emission. This new fleet of primarily electric vehicles (EV) will require a massive installment of EV charging stations. Several states and utility companies are already investing billions of dollars in research for charging capabilities and installment of EV charging stations in big cities. We need to make sure that the areas in between the big cities are not left behind. My plan will invest $50 billion in EV charging station infrastructure in nonurban areas in order to ensure that there is complete coverage of charging stations across the country. \n\nSecond, aircrafts need to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. No current technology exists that would produce a fleet of planes that could fly completely emission free. Fully electric aircrafts at that scale aren't likely to exist before 2050. Aircrafts also have a long life; many planes flown today will still be flying 20-30 years from now. We need to (1) find alternative fuels that can significantly reduce current aircraft emissions, and (2) establish enough carbon capture systems to capture the aircraft emissions that remain. \n\nGovernment will invest in the carbon capture piece of the puzzle and will require the private and commercial sector to figure out how to meet lower established emission standards with alternative fuel. Several alternative fuels could surface in the next 15-20 years that allow aircrafts fly with little to no emissions. Prospects include jet biofuel and sustainable aviation fuel made from algae, municipal waste, and used cooking oil. The federal government also needs to invest in developing low emission aircrafts for our military and government air travel.\n\nThird, public transportation needs to run on renewable energy. Public transit infrastructure all over the country is crumbling. The backlog cost to fix it is $90 billion and estimated to reach $122 billion by 2032. Since we need to spend this money anyway, we might as well invest more up front to make our public transit systems run on renewable energy. That's just common sense.\n\nEvery state operates a different public transit system, so it is important that federal dollars earmarked for sustainable public transit be given directly to the states with specific standards and expectations of net-zero emission public transit by 2040 attached. The federal government can establish these standards, create a central database to share data between the states, and provide grants to states to ensure they make the transition to fully renewable public transit. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- People will not buy electric vehicles if charging stations are not available; companies will not invest in charging stations if there are not enough electric vehicles on the road.\n- Air transportation cannot fly completely emissions free.\n- Most public transportation systems run on fossil fuels, are crumbling, and the backlog is costing local governments hundreds of billions of dollars. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Promote emission free (electric) vehicles by investing in electric charging stations in nonurban areas\n- Get air travel to net-zero emissions by through the use of biofuel and carbon capture technologies\n- Convert all public transportation systems to renewables",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Immediately create a system similar to the ZEV program in California, and require all vehicles starting with 2030 models to be zero-emission\n- Invest $50 billion in EV charging stations in nonurban areas.\n- All commercial, private, and government aircrafts to move toward low-emission standards as is technically feasible by 2040.\n- Government investment of $2 billion in carbon capture technologies research and $9.5 billion over 15 years in installing carbon capture systems that can equal out the remaining limited amount of air travel emissions.\n- Government investment of $300 billion over 15 years into research for alternative aircraft fuel.\n- Create a $200 billion grant program to states to convert their public transportation systems (trains, buses, school buses) to electric vehicles."

            "I have met with several veteran groups and one vet told me something profound. \"It's not that employers just aren't pro-veteran. They are actually looking for reasons to say no and rule you out because they think you're damaged goods.\"\n\nThere's a general belief among Americans that most veterans suffer from a mental health issue, despite that number being much, much smaller. The first thing we need to do is better inform the American people and, in particular, employers on this reality to combat this prejudice against hiring veterans.\n\nWe also need to invest in, and create, mentorship programs for veterans. Non-profits such as American Corporate Partners are doing great work at matching veterans with mentors who can help them find and adapt to a new career. We should invest in other non-profits, and create programs within the federal government, that also help veterans adjust to civilian life. And we should also incentivize businesses to create mentorship programs internally, that provide both a non-veteran and veteran mentor to newly hired veterans. These mentors could help veterans in their careers, and also advocate internally for veteran candidates to be hired.\n\nIn order to help veterans find fulfilling and stable careers, the government should research and maintain a database of in-demand skills and professions, and match veterans to these jobs based on their skills. The government can also partner with businesses in these areas to match up qualified candidates, and incentivize businesses to hire veterans. This can take the form of subsidies, both for the hiring itself and also for the investment in helping the veteran transition from their career in the military to their career at this business, since the rigidity, culture, requirements, and networking required can be very different, and a transition/learning window is often required.\n\nFinally, the federal government should provide resources to veteran-run businesses. This can take the form of initial investment, low-cost financing options, and preferential treatment.\n\n*(Read Andrew's full policy of Veteran Assistance [here](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/more-than-a-handshake/).)* ",

This is unacceptable, and I commit to decreasing it substantially during my first term as President.\n\nIt's important to note that there are differences in chronic and situational veteran homelessness. Improving stability and employment will help primarily with situational homelessness, while chronic homelessness is usually related to health/mental health issues.\n\nHelping with their transition to civilian life and increasing employment and stability is a huge step in decreasing the number of situationally homeless veterans. Improving mental health resources and treatment is a huge step in combating chronic homelessness.\n\nIn order to directly tackle this issue, however, we need to start by establishing a census-like team that will research and find all of our homeless veterans and get them and their information into the VA system. This will allow the health professionals to treat any mental or physical health issues that are contributing to the homelessness, as well as enroll them in other programs to help with employment, financial literacy, and general life skills.\n\nWe also need to help veterans afford housing through financial literacy, assistance in saving up for a down payment or security deposit (including by instituting programs while they're still in active service, to dedicate portions of their pay specifically to retirement and post-discharge housing), mortgage options, and, if it comes to it, assistance in foreclosure proceedings (including incentives for mortgage companies to find alternatives to foreclosures).\n\nWe can also do more to increase the availability of affordable housing options.

We need to get Congress back in the habit of serving the people, not serving out careers.\n\nSome elections have seen reelection rates at 98%, with 90% being the norm. Even years where a wave election happens, reelection rates tend to be above 80%. Compare this to earlier elections with much higher turnover rates, such as in 1854 when around a third of all seats changed hands.\n\nAround 13% of the House will have served for almost 2 decades in 2020, which pales to the approx. 20% in the Senate.

Legislators gain experience over time, and they form coalitions. Short term limits would also entrench the non-legislative bureaucracy.\n\nThis is why the best balance would be longer term limits - 12 years for each chamber of Congress. This would allow legislators enough time to build up sufficient experience and relationships to accomplish their goals, and then get them out before they stagnate and start to engage in self-dealing.

            "Decades of fighting the spread of all wildfires has prevented a natural cycle of thinning that had kept forest fires under control. Before European settlement of the West, 1.5m acres would burn each year; since then, it's been about 57k acres/year. Less than 2% of California forestland saw proactive treatment in some recent years, and one of the most effective means at controlling future fires - prescribed burns - is limited by cultural and legal hurdles, EPA standards and the Endangered Species Act. However, this takes a short-term view on the dangers of uncontrolled wildfires to both environmental quality and animals in these habitats.\n\nWe have a problem in this country, and it's costing us billions of dollars a year. It's only going to get worse as climate change exacerbates the problem. We need to start listening to what the experts recommend on how to control these fires.\n\nMore money needs to be spent on prevention to match the scope of the problem, and we need to properly fund the US Forest Service in order to proactively address threats before they become fires. We need to provide western states with the same amount of funding for local fire prevention and emergency preparedness planning initiatives. We also need to shift our cultural view that all wildfires must be stopped in order to allow the natural cycle to regain control.\n\nThese natural fires need to be supplemented with prescribed burns, which stay limited to their defined areas 99% of the time. The EPA must take a long-term view towards the dangers of megafires versus prescribed fires when analyzing the environmental impact of controlled burns.\n\nFinally, we need the federal government to partner with state and local governments to aggressively collaborate in finding solutions to these life-threatening risks. The federal government can properly fund the cost of preventing and fighting fires on federal land, while also learning from state best practices in administering these prevention efforts. The federal government can assist state efforts by providing a federal fire insurance program that depends on the homeowner's compliance with state fire prevention policies. Incentives for developing land in safe areas also need to be implemented, either through changes to federal standards, changes to mortgage-interest deductions for housing built in high-risk areas, or the implementation of a federal fire insurance program, to price in the costs of living in high risk areas.

",
            "## Goals\n\n- Readjust incentives and priorities to promote investments that will reduce the frequency and impact of megafires\n- Work with states to implement the expert fire prevention methods and emergency response systems they have developed\n- Provide homeowners access to fire insurance along with requirements to employ certain fire prevention techniques",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Quintuple the budget for the U.S. Forest Service to $24.5 billion for at least 5 years, and specifically tailor it to focus on fire prevention, and promote partnerships with local experts on combating wildfires in their areas. This will more than pay for itself by preventing megafires. \n- Appoint a Secretary of Agriculture who recognizes the importance of preventing megafires using science-backed techniques.\n- Work with federal agencies such as the EPA to adjust how specific metrics are measured to take a more long-term view of the costs and benefits of prescribed fires.\n- Work with Congress to pass legislation aligning incentives for states, developers, and homeowners towards fire prevention and avoiding high-risk areas.\n- Establish a National Fire Insurance Program that provides insurance for homeowners in high risk fire zones, with a stipulation that homes must take preventative actions such as defensible space and reevaluation standards in case locations are determined to be dangerous for rebuilding.

Brand name prescription drug prices have risen [76%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6547085/) over the past 6 years, and they're not slowing down. Patent trolls, or nonoperating companies that extract cash settlements from companies they accuse of patent infringement, can drive the prices of certain medications up while providing no value themselves to the US healthcare system. \n\nAnd while drug companies complain constantly about the high cost of research, they fail to mention that almost all FDA-approved drugs over the past several years relied on basic research funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH). They also don't mention the record-high profits they've been experiencing in recent years. While drug companies bring in only 23% of healthcare's U.S. revenue, they make [63%](https://www.axios.com/pharma-health-care-economy-q3-profits-53b950b2-5515-4d79-b1f5-7067bf3652d1.html) of the total profits.

Americans pay twice as much as Australians and three times as much as the Dutch on prescription drugs due to lack of price control. We have to give the federal government authority to negotiate drug prices and use standard international price reference points so pharmaceutical companies can no longer exploit our market and the American people.\n\nIf these companies are not willing to compromise, we need to ensure the U.S. government has the ability to force licenses for these drugs to companies who will. Additionally, we need to authorize the creation of public manufacturing facilities to make these drugs, as well as other necessary drugs  and unprofitable but necessary medications, for the American people. If all else fails, we need to allow the importation of medications from other countries. ",

The 189 electoral votes currently pledged to the compact (70%) can seem close to the necessary 270 to effectively get rid of the electoral college, but looking at the remaining states leaves one wondering which are likely to sign on. Even the states that have already signed are precarious - the next election could see new elected officials who withdraw from the compact.\n\nThere are, without a doubt, problems with the electoral college.

It depresses voter turnout in states that are securely blue or red.\n\nIf we're going to attempt to reform the electoral college, it would be better to focus on making electors determined on a proportional basis. The method of determining electors isn't prescribed in the Constitution, and several states already use a different method. While a constitutional amendment might be required to force states to determine their electors proportionally, any individual state could determine to use a proportional method immediately, and have the electors better reflect the will of the people of their state.

Yale's endowment is $27b, while it has an undergraduate class size of ~1500 and an acceptance rate of under 7%. Stuyvesant, a top NYC public school, has a class size only slightly over 3200, while there are over 1.1m students in the public school system. Phillips Exeter Academy, a high school, has an endowment of over $1 million per student. \n\nThese schools are not for everyone and we have bigger problems to address that are more relevant for most Americans. However, these schools reflect a false scarcity in our elite education system - instead of expanding access and opportunities, many schools remain small and selective because the prestige of turning many people down helps them maintain cachet and rankings. This has, in turn, warped parent and student behavior towards cutthroat competition, driving extreme, unhealthy, unethical, and even illegal behaviors. It is deranging our culture.\n\nMany highly selective schools have the resources to expand their class sizes, but they currently don't have an incentive to do so. Their rankings pressures actually reward them for rejecting many applicants.\n\nWe need to to provide incentives for these schools to expand, both in size and, in the case of colleges, geographically. The geographic benefits would extend past just the increase in capacity. By establishing campuses in different parts of the region or country, these schools would:\n\n-     - Expand the pool of people who would attend;\n    - Provide a cheaper cost of living on certain campuses, making it easier to afford these educational opportunities;\n    - Create alumni networks nearby, thus attracting talent to new areas of the country; and\n    - Afford students the opportunity to \"study abroad\" at home, and take classes at different campuses to get exposed to different areas of the country.\n\nArtificial scarcity has been created at these highly selective academic resources in the name of institutional prestige. It's time instead to create opportunities for more American students. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Highly selective schools are seeing skyrocketing application numbers, resulting in plummeting acceptance rates.\n- These schools are not expanding to larger class sizes and new areas despite having the resources to do so. ",

            "Our Founding Fathers intended the judicial branch of government to be free of political pressures, interpreting and applying the Constitution to the laws passed by Congress in order to ensure that no violations were found.\n\nToday, the Supreme Court is increasingly polarized around political lines, and the selection of a new Justice is a bitter fight that divides the country. The process has become increasingly contentious, and very few Americans believe that the Supreme Court is impartial. \n\nThe first step in ensuring that the Supreme Court doesn't lose the faith of the American people is to establish a clear code of ethics that applies to the Justices. Currently, all inferior courts have a Code of Ethics applied to them, and violations can be litigated. However, as the Supreme Court of the land, there's no applicable Code that applies to its members.\n\nCongress has put a few requirements on Justices - recusement requirements and financial disclosure requirements - that the Justices have abided by. It's time that a full Code of Ethics is established, ensuring that people know our Supreme Court Justices are acting ethically.\n\nAdditionally, the stakes involved in the appointment of Supreme Court justices are creating partisan battles that divide our country, create bitter resentment, and allow individuals to delegitimize later decisions with which they disagree.\n\nThe stats largely back up that we do have a partisan problem on the Supreme Court. The number of 5-4 decisions, reflecting the line between Republican-appointed and Democrat-appointed Justices, has increased in recent years. When a new seat opens up, lifetime appointments incentivize finding the youngest, most partisan jurist who can gain confirmation in order to ensure a particular bent on the Court for as long as possible. Current Justices can expect to serve for 40 or more years. For historical context, the average Justice has served for 15 years, though Justices appointed since 1970 have served for an average of 26 years.\n\nThis isn't the way it was envisioned at the founding of our country, when life expectancy was shorter and Justices would often retire or resign well ahead of their deaths. We need to return some level of sanity and balance to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe answer to this is to impose term limits on Justices, and set their terms at regular intervals. Each President should be allowed to appoint two Justices per term served, in their first and third years in office. ",

            "While the 2018 midterm elections saw the highest turnout in a non-presidential year since 1914, that turnout was still under 50%. Presidential election turnout hovers between 50% and 65%. This is low. While reforms making it easier to vote should be implemented as well, we can also increase civic engagement and regular voting by lowering the voting age.\n\nStudies show that allowing younger people to vote has positive impacts on overall voting habits. Localities that have lowered the voting age have seen an increase in voter turnout across all age groups. Other studies have shown that delaying when a person first votes (because of birth dates and election cycles) decreases the likelihood that they will become a regular voter.\n\nAt 16, Americans don't have hourly limits imposed on their work, and they pay taxes. Their livelihoods are directly impacted by legislation, and they should therefore be allowed to vote for their representatives.\n\nAdditionally, because of election cycles, there's a level of unfairness that comes with what year a person is born. Senators are on a 6-year cycle, and the president is on a 4-year cycle, not to mention local offices. Someone born at the wrong time in a cycle would have to wait much longer to cast a ballot for certain offices than someone born at another time. While that's true if the voting age is lowered to 16, it decreases the age at which the person is first allowed to vote for that office, thus allowing them to have a longer period of their life where they feel represented. ",

The unconvicted jail population is two to three times the size of the convicted population.\n\nThird, bail determinations are highly subjective, with individuals receiving vastly different bail amounts for similar crimes.\n\nFinally, the inability to pay cash bail obviously falls more frequently on those with lower levels of income.

This culminated in the decision made in Citizens United, allowing unlimited money to be spent by corporations in elections.\n\nIt's no surprise that this has resulted in mega-donors flooding the pipes of our democracy.\n\nWe need to diminish the influence that mega-wealthy individuals and companies have in our elections. While we must push for a Constitutional amendment to allow our campaign finance laws to properly limit the power that the top 1% have, we must act much faster to save our democratic processes. To do so, we must make it possible for all Americans to contribute to candidates they feel strongly about, in order to drown out the voices of the few who can spend millions of dollars to influence our politicians.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to provide Americans with publicly funded vouchers they can use to donate to politicians that they support. Every American gets $100 a year to give to candidates, use it or lose it. These Democracy Dollars would, by the sheer volume of the US population, drown out the influence of mega-donors. \n\nImagine running for office when every American has $100 Democracy Dollars to give to their favorite candidate. Just 10,000 supporters could mean $1 million for your campaign. Once elected, you could act primarily in the interest of the people you represent instead of appeasing wealthy donors and corporations.

            "One of the most common sentiments you hear every election is that most people don't get to vote for someone they like, but rather are forced to pick between the lesser of two evils.\n\n**Why do we accept a system that leads us to feel that we're voting for the person who is going to do the least bad instead of the most good?** Our current plurality voting system, where everyone selects a single preference and then the person with the most votes wins, is viewed negatively by election scientists, for several reasons:\n\n\n-     - It's vulnerable to a spoiler effect, where a third-party candidate can take just enough votes away from a candidate to cause them to lose, even if that candidate would be preferred to the eventual winner.\n    - It can cause strategic voting, where voters don't vote for their favorite but rather the person they like who is most likely to win.\n    - Especially with a party-based primary system, it leads to partisanship, as centrist candidates, despite having wider support, lose out to candidates who appeal to the fringes of each party.\n\nThere are many alternative voting systems that are superior to plurality voting. We should move to a ranked-choice/single transferable vote voting system, a system that has recently been implemented in Maine and is being explored by many other localities. \n\nIn ranked-choice voting, each voter ranks their top three candidates, from 1 to 3. After this is complete, every voter's first choice is tallied. If one candidate received over 50% of the vote, they win the election. If no candidate hit the majority threshold, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Then, everyone who listed that eliminated candidate as their first choice has their second choice considered, a process which continues until someone breaks 50%. \n\nThe benefits of this type of system include:\n\n- **Higher turnout**. Ranked-choice voting in general elections is associated with a 10-point increase in voter turnout.\n- **Better capturing voter preferences**. Since each voter is allowed to express how they feel about more candidates, the outcome tends to reflect the choices of voters better.\n- **Allows for more moderate candidates**. A candidate that has broad, cross-aisle appeal is more likely to win using a ranked-choice voting system since voters can express their preference for a more partisan candidate as well as the more moderate choice.\n- **Lowers levels of negative campaigning**. Since each voter can potentially vote for a candidate as well as their opponent, candidates shy from negative campaigning that would alienate the supporters of other candidates, instead trying to appeal to those voters as their second or third choice.

            "Both experiencing and creating art in any form is personally enriching and spurs economic development and community engagement. Artists have the same effect on a community as entrepreneurs over time. However, many artists and arts organizations can't generate enough revenue to cover their costs or make their art financially accessible to a wide range of people. Due to budget cuts to the arts, we're seeing a scaling-back or closing of programs offered by all types of arts organizations, including museums, theaters, dance and opera companies, and orchestras. This has been a severe loss to people, their communities, and our society.\n\nAdditionally, the way that people consume art, especially music and film, has drastically changed over the past several decades. However, our copyright and licensing legislation hasn't. It's time to revisit these laws in order to ensure that creativity can still thrive while artists receive fair compensation.\n\nWhile the Freedom Dividend will provide people with financial support to pursue their artistic endeavors, there is much more we can do to support the arts in this country. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Arts organizations across the country, including educational programs, are struggling to survive, despite their popularity.\n- Many individuals abandon their creative dreams due to economic insecurity, lack of time, or a sense that our society doesn't value art.\n- The US government is underinvesting in the arts.\n- Spending for the arts as a percentage of GDP is miniscule (.02%), and the National Endowment for the Arts receives just .014% of discretionary spending. This for a sector that accounts for 4.2% of GDP and receives much more significant investment in other developed countries.\n- Current copyright law is outdated and based on decades of changes and exceptions being granted to large corporations, at odds with the intent of the original laws.\n- Modern distribution services have led to artists not receiving fair royalties, for example musicians fees for music streamed online. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Provide resources to sustain the education, creation, and offerings of all forms of art\n- Incentivize individuals and corporations to increase their support for the arts\n- Increase civic engagement and greater understanding between people through the arts\n- Modernize and fix copyright laws to address technological changes and \"copyright creep\" over the decades\n- Modernize licensing structures to provide artists with fair compensation",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Restore NEA and NEH funding to at least pre-1996 levels, adjusted for inflation.\n- Support changes in the tax law to spur investment in film, television, and live theatrical productions (Section 181 of the federal tax code). \n- Bring greater awareness to how individuals and local communities throughout the country benefit from federal support for arts programs.\n- Strongly support existing programs that offer art and music education in primary and secondary schools, and push for more such programs. They have been demonstrated to improve education outcomes. \n- Explore the feasibility of creating a national theater.\n- Assemble experts in copyright to propose ways to change copyright law in order to spur creativity.\n- Continue to iterate on the Music Modernization Act, and promote similar policies that will bring our laws around compensation for the arts into the modern, streaming/internet era."

People should receive equal pay for doing equal work. While federal law requires this, we're still far from achieving it in practice.

By having it increase at regular intervals, we can allow businesses to plan for their transition to sustainable energy. By having those intervals be aggressive, we can be sure to hit our net-zero target on schedule.\n\nStarting at $40/ton, the fee would raise hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Increasing it by $5/year for the first 4 years and then $10/year until we hit net-zero emissions would ensure that businesses have a \"deadline\" for the transition, but can still make the transition on a timeline that makes sense for them. By some estimations, even a less aggressive carbon fee structure would reduce emissions by 90% by 2050.\n\nWhile the amount of money would necessarily decrease over time, eventually zero-ing out, we can use the money before that time to help fund the transition to a sustainable economy, especially by subsidizing the costs of residential upgrades.

Independent executive agency lists range from 78 to 137, and Cabinet units range from 174 to 268. Other lists have over 440 agencies within the federal government. Congress and Executive officials have delegated responsibilities to each of these agencies without always taking into account the purview of other departments. This has created a wide area of shared regulatory space, which means not only are resources being wasted as more than one group is tasked with addressing an issue, but sometimes conflicting information or regulations are formulated.\n\nAdditionally, expertise is wasted when agencies don't know the resources available to them through other, complementary agencies. Coordination should be baked into the ethos of these organizations, and cross-agency management should be focused on identifying areas where work can be streamlined and improved.\n\nFinally, these agencies tend to fall into patterns over time, failing to bring in the most talented members of the younger generations or improving the technology they rely on. It's important that these agencies are equipped to attract and retain the best talent available, and that they have the resources they need to upgrade their systems in a way that maximizes their utility to the American public, as well as their security.\n\nIn short, these agencies should be rewarded for streamlining operations within themselves while coordinating with other agencies to work in a consistent and well informed manner, while also optimizing operations, staff, and technology.

Studies have shown that complaints drop dramatically when police officers are wearing cameras, both because of police conduct and because suspects behave better when they know they're being recorded. It's common sense. Everyone is going to act differently if they think what they're saying or doing can be played back in a courtroom months later.\n\nThere are 18,000 different local law enforcement agencies, from the smallest town's to the NYPD. Each agency is subject to its own budget, leadership, and regulations. Nationally, there are thousands of decision makers each balancing different interests and budgetary constraints, making widespread adoption difficult.\n\nIt would cost approximately $400 million to equip all 1.1 million US police officers with body-worn cameras (current costs are approximately $350 apiece, not including data storage costs and maintenance).\n\nApproximately 400 to 1,000 Americans get shot and killed per year by police (the stats aren't clearly kept, which is its [own massive problem](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/)), some of which may be avoidable.

            "Mental health is an important component of our overall health, and it should be treated that way by our healthcare system. There is a mental health crisis in America with [1 in 5 adults](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018.pdf) experiencing mental illness annually. \n\nOur life expectancy is declining due in part to increasing rates of suicide, especially among American youth. The teen suicide rate has gone up [56%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db352-h.pdf) from 2007 to 2017, and it is the second leading cause of death for Americans between the ages 10 and 34. [7.7 million](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2724377?guestAccessKey=f689aa19-31f1-481d-878a-6bf83844536a) youth aged 6-17 experience a mental health disorder each year, but only half receive treatment. Anxiety and depression levels are at record highs. People of color and the LGBTQ community also experience higher risk of mental health issues due to disproportionate social and economic challenges. \n\nOur veterans, too, do not receive the necessary mental health treatment they need when they come home. [22](https://www.va.gov/opa/docs/suicide-data-report-2012-final.pdf) veterans commit suicide every day since many don't seek treatment due to embarrassment or shame. We need to destigmatize veteran treatment and support their stability to ensure successful transition to civilian life.\n\nSubstance abuse and mental health account for [1 of 8](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb216-Mental-Substance-Use-Disorder-ED-Visit-Trends.pdf) emergency department visits. Only [43%](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018.pdf) of Americans with a mental illness receive treatment due to inadequate insurance coverage and provider shortages. It is urgent to integrate mental health care into health insurance plans and destigmatize mental health care while encouraging an increase in the number of people able to provide treatment.\n\nOutside of mental illness, applying evidence-based stress relief methods in hospitals has been shown to shorten the length of stay. This is just one example of how caring for a patient's mental health has demonstrable cost benefits. By creating a healthcare system that recognizes mental health as an integral part of physical health, we can improve both. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- There is currently a mental health crisis in America as suicides, anxiety and depression are at record highs\n- Mental health is often treated as a separate set of issues and resources rather than integrated into the greater health care system\n- Many communities lack access to psychologists and social workers\n- Mental health issues continue to be stigmatized ",

            "Approximately [115 Americans](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis) die each day from an opioid overdose. Many more struggle through addiction, including all the negative health and behavioral impacts that it entails. Nearly [220 million](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/pubs/2017-cdc-drug-surveillance-report.pdf) prescriptions for opioids were written in 2016, despite the risks of these drugs being well known, and over [2.6 million](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/pubs/2017-cdc-drug-surveillance-report.pdf) are addicted to opiates.\n\nOutside of the immediate health effects, drug trafficking and related crimes have sprung up in communities throughout America in order to cater to these addictions. And our country's healthcare system, complicit in the creation of the crisis, hasn't found a way to treat the outbreak.\n\nThe opioid crisis isn't just a nationwide public health emergency - it's a [national crisis](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/10/26/hhs-acting-secretary-declares-public-health-emergency-address-national-opioid-crisis.html). Tens of thousands of people are dying each year, with millions more suffering from an addiction. Many of these people's addictions started when they were prescribed these medications by a doctor. The human suffering caused by this crisis cannot be measured, and the economic damage is untold.\n\nWe must do more than declare this a crisis and hope the issue solves itself.\n\nThe federal government, through the Department of Health and Human Services, must find solutions to this emergency and coordinate with the states in its implementation. The CDC must use its expertise to quantify and combat this plague. The FDA must implement new steps to ensure that a similar crisis doesn't develop in the future. Most of all, we have to fund treatment for everyday Americans.\n\nHowever, the federal government must also recognize its limitations in this crisis. While funding research and solutions is something the federal government is good at, this epidemic is affecting people on an individual level. Local governments will be much better able to experiment with and implement solutions that will work for their communities. The federal government, through funding and centralization, can help the work of states and local communities in this crisis, but it should serve as a motivating and coordinating force in order to ensure adopted policies work for the people on the ground. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- The opioid epidemic is destroying the lives of millions of people directly, and untold millions more through the impact they're seeing of it on their loved ones.\n- The regulation of drugs and the sale of those drugs for unintended uses must be improved.\n- Treatment resources are lacking with only a fraction of addicts able to effectively recover from their addiction. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Reduce the production of and use of opioids for general pain management\n- Provide treatment resources and options for those addicted to opioids, taking into account local cultural mores\n- Prevent a similar crisis from developing in the future with stricter regulations on marketing and sales tactics",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Declare a state of emergency and seek to bring down both the overdose numbers and the addiction levels by 20% within four years. \n- Quintuple Federal funding, from $4.5 to $20 billion per year directed toward addiction treatment and rehabilitation for addictive opiates at the local levels. \n- Impose a new tax on opiate manufacturers to fund treatment and rehabilitation, retroactive to 2005. The drug companies will pay to treat the conditions they have profited from. \n- The FDA should allow only doctors who complete specialized education in pain management to prescribe opioids for more than a few days. All states should limit the size of prescriptions and require all opioid prescriptions to be made from hospitals instead of individual offices/practices. Right now our prescription rate is 4 times higher than in Europe - we need to bring it down. Doctors need to tell more patients that they'll feel better on their own without having to take opiates. \n- Direct the Dept. of Health and Human Services to focus their resources on combating the epidemic until it's under control:\n\n    - Create a centralized database of solutions and effectiveness\n    - Create a centralized database of data to help analyze the trends of the opioid epidemic and better target resources\n    - Provide funding to localities to experiment with solutions that work for their communities\n- Direct the FDA to regulate pharmaceutical company marketing tactics as much as they regulate the release of new drugs. \n- Insurance companies should provide more oversight of prescriptions to curb abuse and report these measures to the Dept. of Health and Human Services. \n- Overdose patients should be sent to mandatory treatment centers for three days to convince them to seek long-term treatment. \n- Work with the DEA to enforce a much stricter limit on the number of opioid-based medications that can be produced in any given year and instruct manufacturers to report drugs prescribed in each community so as to monitor excess supply and probable abuse. \n- Destigmatize medication-based treatment options for opiate addiction. We need to do whatever works best, including drugs that enable addicts to recover in stages. \n- Allow local law enforcement authorities to selectively enforce criminal laws related to use and possession of opiates to facilitate treatment.\n- Work to limit the importation of heroin and fentanyl, particularly from China. The Chinese government must do more to curb supply before it enters our country--we should negotiate for marked and demonstrated reductions in return for continued market access. "

The necessary recovery time for the mother and baby to reach optimal health is a minimum of [6](https://www.newamerica.org/better-life-lab/reports/paid-family-leave-how-much-time-enough/) months. Yet, most women have to return to work just two weeks after childbirth. In California and New Jersey, mothers with state-level paid parental leave saw an increased labor force participation in the months surrounding childbirth and a [6-9%](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/es_20170606_paidfamilyleave.pdf) increase in the average weekly work hours of employed mothers with children. \n\nPaid family leave for fathers is typically more limited than paid leave for mothers, but lengthened paternity leave has shown [increased](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OASP/legacy/files/PaternityBrief.pdf) father engagement and bonding, improved health and development outcomes for children, and increased gender equity at home and in the workplace. It's clear that families benefit when both parents, irrespective of gender, are supported in raising their newborn children. We need to implement paid family leave policies with gender neutral terms that do not undervalue any parent, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. \n\nSingle-mother households make up [21%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/27/about-one-third-of-u-s-children-are-living-with-an-unmarried-parent/) of families in the U.S., 30% of which are living in poverty, and experience a decline in their income after having a baby.

[Studies](http://timetocareny.org/paidleave) show paid family leave has a positive effect on business productivity, profitability, and even employee morale. Paid family leave for all parents has also been shown to result in employee retention increasing, and costly turnover decreases. \n\nAnd while the conversation around paid leave tends to focus on new parents, today almost three-quarters of workers who use their Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave use it for a purpose outside of having a new child. [55%](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2019/07/16/472026/paid-family-medical-leave-must-comprehensive-help-workers-children/) used it to recover from their own illness, and 18% used it to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition, whether that was a parent, spouse, or child. 27.8% of FMLA caregiver leaves are taken by workers tending to their seriously ill children.

            "Nuclear power is a crucial component in the move towards creating sustainable, carbon-free energy for the United States. However, many people - including some other candidates - dismiss it out of hand.\n\nWhy does it have such a bad reputation?\n\nTwo reasons. First, the public's perception of its safety has been skewed by TV shows like *Chernobyl* and *The Simpsons*. Second, nuclear waste is dangerous and long-lasting, and disposing of it is expensive.\n\nBoth points are less of an issue with modern reactors.\n\nWhen the [OECD, NEA](https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/reports/2010/nea6861-comparing-risks.pdf), and [NASA](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/kh05000e.html) analyzed the actual danger of nuclear energy compared to other sources, they found that it caused orders of magnitude fewer deaths than fossil fuel-based energy. And that's not even considering the long-term impact of climate change from burning fossil fuels.\n\nWith modern reactors, safety is drastically increased, and nuclear waste is drastically decreased. After the completion of the Manhattan Project, America explored the option of using thorium as a potential source for civilian nuclear power. There is roughly 3 times more thorium on Earth than uranium, and we are already mining it as a byproduct of other rare-earth element mining. Thorium mining is substantially safer than uranium mining, and thorium reactors produce less waste than uranium reactors\n\nWhy did we go with uranium instead of thorium in the 1940s? Uranium is used in nuclear weapons; thorium isn't. Yet another benefit to using thorium as a power source! Nuclear isn't a perfect solution, but it's a solid solution for now, and a technology we should invest in as we move to a future powered primarily by renewable energy. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Nuclear power plants generate a majority of our \"carbon-free\" energy, but they only generate less than 20% of our overall energy, despite being cleaner than fossil fuels.\n- Public opinion is generally misinformed on the safety and effectiveness of nuclear power. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Provide America with emissions free energy sources while other renewable technologies are still developing in efficiency and sustainability\n- Educate the public on how nuclear power can be used safely and effectively",
            "## As President I will...\n\n1. Invest $50 billion in research and development for thorium-based molten salt reactors, and nuclear fusion reactors, to provide a green energy source for Americans.\n2. Engage in a public relations campaign to update the reputation of nuclear reactors. \n3. Plan to start breaking ground on new, safe, thorium-based molten salt nuclear reactors by 2027."

            "Corporations and the wealthy have enough advantages without being able to influence every election by putting up millions of dollars and bending the ear of every candidate and officeholder. \n\nIn the wake of the *Citizens United* ruling (and the lesser-known *Buckley v. Valeo* decision), money has flooded our political system like never before. A handful of wealthy individuals can now raise a voice louder than millions of ordinary Americans put together. The flood of money in politics has led to increased mistrust and disenchantment in our government, and rightly so. Big money in politics is far more likely to support candidates who will protect the interest of the wealthy that elected these candidates in the first place.\n\nSuper PACs can accept unlimited contributions, and disclosure requirements allow donations to be funneled through nonprofits until they can't be traced to their original source - this is Dark Money. Super PAC spending in federal elections more than doubled between 2010 and 2012. Swing states such as Pennsylvania, Florida, and North Carolina see the largest Dark Money spending, undoubtedly seeing their elections influenced by wealthy donors that have no ties to the state itself.\n\nWe must return to the essence of democracy - where each person's vote is heard and treated equally. I will gladly push for a constitutional amendment to overturn *Citizens United* and return the American government to its people. We need to end Super PACs, drown out their influence, and stop pretending that corporations have equal rights to people. ",

            "Traditionally, the economy has been measured by looking at the gross domestic product (GDP) or the stock market. Employment rates and household income are also used to measure how the average worker is doing.\n\nHowever, even the creator of the GDP admits that it doesn't really reflect the full story. And, as economic inequality rises and the fruits of society's labors accrue to fewer individuals, it's become obvious that we need to expand our definition of economic prosperity past a single number. The bottom 80% of Americans only own 8% of stocks and rising GDP has virtually no relationship with each citizen's wellbeing.\n\nWhen you measure something, you implicitly set your policy goals. By focusing our measurement on GDP, we've promoted production over all else. It's time to start measuring economic prosperity using a wider index that measures human as well as monetary indicators, such as (but not limited to):\n\n-     - Quality of life and health-adjusted life expectancy\n    - Happiness/Well-Being and Mental Health\n    - Environmental quality\n    - Affordability\n    - Childhood success rates\n    - Underemployment\n    - Income Inequality\n    - Consumer and Student Debt\n    - Work and civic engagement levels\n    - Volunteerism\n    - Infant mortality\n    - Quality of infrastructure\n    - Access to education\n    - Marriage and divorce rates\n    - Substance abuse and related deaths\n    - National optimism\n    - Personal dynamism/economic mobility\n\nIn short, why use GDP as a proxy for how Americans are doing when we can easily measure that well-being directly? Let's start an American Scorecard, directly measuring the things we should be focusing on. ",

Many consider it to have \"won\" the war of ideas against socialism, but that simplistic view ignores that there is no such thing as a pure Capitalist system. And our current version of institutional capitalism and corporatism is a relatively recent development.\n\nOur current emphasis on corporate profits isn't working for the vast majority of Americans. This will only be made worse by the development of automation technology and AI.\n\nWe need to move to a new form of capitalism - Human Capitalism - that's geared towards maximizing human well-being and fulfillment. The central tenets of Human Capitalism are:\n\n1. Humans are more important than money\n2. The unit of a Human Capitalism economy is each person, not each dollar\n3. Markets exist to serve our common goals and values\n\nThe focus of our economy should be to maximize human welfare. Sometimes this aligns with a purely capitalist approach, where different entities compete for the best ideas. But there are plenty of times when a capitalist system leads to suboptimal outcomes.

New measurements like Median Income and Standard of Living, Health-adjusted Life Expectancy, Mental Health, Childhood Success Rates, Social and Economic Mobility, Absence of Substance Abuse, and others will give us a much clearer and more powerful sense of how we are doing both individually and as a society.\n- Rein in corporate excesses by appointing regulators who are paid a lot of money - competitive with senior jobs in the private sector - but then will be prohibited from going to private industry afterward.  Regulators need to be focused on making the right decisions and policies for the public with zero concern for their next position.\n- The government should create a modern timebanking system that will reward people and organizations who drive significant social value."

The specter of needing to figure out the complex rules of the tax code hangs over each of us for the first third of the year, and most of us rush during April to come in under the deadline.\n\n75% of Americans receive refunds. For those Americans, they've been (essentially) giving the US Government an interest-free loan through most of the year. They'd be better off having access to that money at the time they earn it. For the other 25% of Americans, needing to find the money to pay their tax balance adds unnecessary stress to their lives.\n\nAfter taxes are filed, many Americans then spend weeks dreading an audit, hoping that the IRS doesn't randomly select them. That process itself can add cost to the tax process, as most people don't have the required expertise to deal with the IRS's auditors.\n\nCurrently, paying taxes is a slog. Let's make it a celebration.\n\nThe IRS has almost all the information they need to calculate your taxes within a fair degree of accuracy. They can do this automatically, guaranteeing that you hold on to more of your money throughout the year and will never need to spend money on expensive tax-preparation services or audit-protection insurance.\n\nWith the pain of filing taxes out of the way, we can change that April date to Revenue Day a federal holiday where we celebrate everything the federal government does for American citizens.\n\nEach American should be able to direct 1% of their taxes to a specific project. During Revenue Day, these projects will be highlighted, showing what, exactly, America's money was able to accomplish during the previous year. Initial profiles of the next year's projects will also be announced so people can get excited for them. ",

Money spent on the IRS will almost certainly pay for itself many times over via better tax compliance and less wasted time of citizens.\n- Declare Tax Day to be Revenue Day, a federal holiday to celebrate all the projects undertaken or completed by the federal government in the previous year, and announcing new projects.\n- Allow each American to direct 1% of their taxes to a specific project, department or activity of government (e.g. Veterans Affairs, National Endowment for the Arts, etc.)."

            "A Value-Added Tax (VAT) is currently used by 160 out of 193 countries, including every developed nation except the US, because it is a more efficient way of generating revenue with no loopholes. Big companies and rich people are excellent at moving assets around to avoid taxes - Amazon, Google, and other companies funnel hundreds of billions in earnings overseas. In fact, Amazon paid zero in taxes last year. A VAT makes it impossible for them to benefit from the American people, automation, and infrastructure without paying their fair share.\n\nBy implementing a VAT, the American people will get a tiny sliver from the transactions of the big winners from the 21st century economy, the trillion dollar tech companies. \n\nThese revenues will help finance the Freedom Dividend and provide a floor for millions of Americans to build on, incentivizing businesses to control costs, encouraging savings, and simplifying administration. While transactions through the supply chain are taxed, only a [fraction ](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15214.pdf)of that tax is passed on to consumers. Coupled with the Freedom Dividend, it will be quite progressive.\n\nWhy are VATs so popular in the rest of the world, especially among industrialized nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)? They're difficult to dodge and easy to implement. By taking a slice at each point that value switches hands in the supply chain, big corporations will pay into the system to bring their products to market. If you want to do business in America, you have to pay into America. That's it. This system doesn't privilege foreign goods because a VAT is equally applied to imported goods.\n\nThis is how we ensure big tech companies pay their fair share and Americans share in the gains of the 21st century economy. Other industrialized countries have cracked the code after trying numerous schemes, from a wealth tax to a VAT. And while I agree with a wealth tax in spirit, there is a reason why it has been repealed by almost all European countries who have attempted them. We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes. Instead, we should look at the tax system in 160 countries like Germany and France that set up future generations for success, which is a value-added tax. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Corporations move money around to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.\n- The burden of paying for social services falls disproportionately on those who earn the least.\n- The Freedom Dividend should be funded by those who benefit most from the structure and work of society. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Generate a revenue stream that can't be avoided by corporations who are trying to circumvent our taxation system\n- Generate revenue that will be consistent with increasing automation",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Implement a Value-Added Tax at 10%, half the European level.  Over time, the VAT will become more and more important to capture the value generated by automation in a way that income taxes would not.\n\n    - This VAT would vary based on the good to which it's applied, with staples having a lower rate or being excluded, and luxury goods having a higher rate.\n- Use the VAT revenue to pay for the Freedom Dividend of $1,000/month per adult, Universal Basic Income."

            "If not the most significant technological development of the past 50 years, the internet is certainly somewhere at the top of the list. It's enabled an unprecedented dissemination of knowledge to the vast majority of Americans while also becoming an integral part of our economy and the way we entertain ourselves. It's an essential part of our modern lives.\n\nThe repeal of net neutrality protections threatens the free internet for all Americans. It is imperative that we protect this technology so that all Americans can continue to enjoy unfettered and affordable access to the internet.\n\nOn top of keeping ISPs classified under Title II, competition should be increased through local-loop unbundling. This would provide startups with access to the expensive, final wires connecting the internet \"backbone\" to residences so that they can innovate and compete in an otherwise stifled market. By doing so, prices will come down away from their current monopoly levels and thus increase internet access further. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Reclassifying ISPs under Title I allows them to begin slowing down your internet and charging you more for services you currently enjoy as part of your internet package\n- Competition is stifled in the ISP market, which drives prices up to monopoly levels ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Keep ISPs from throttling the internet or charging more for access to certain online resources\n- Increase competition between internet providers to keep prices under control and allow for innovation",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Appoint members to the FCC that will immediately reclassify ISPs under Title II of the Communications Act, thus allowing the FCC to regulate them and reinforce net neutrality.\n- Unbundle local loops so that new competitors can innovate and keep prices for internet access under control."

            "Americans have seen the negative impact of technology on their lives. From automation that is displacing their jobs to smart phones that are causing unknown psychological issues for our children, Americans are worried about the future, and need to be able to trust the government to play a role in ensuring that we're prosperous and innovative, but also safe. Technology can bring about new levels of prosperity, but it also holds the potential to disrupt our economies, ruin lives throughout several generations, and, if experts such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk are to be believed, destroy humanity.\n\nTechnology is advancing at a pace never before seen in human history, and even those developing it don't fully understand how it works or what direction it's taking. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that a computer, given certain directives, can learn tasks much faster than humans thought possible even a year ago.\n\nThe level of technological fluency that members of our government has shown has created justified fears in the minds of Americans that the government isn't equipped to create a regulatory system that's designed to protect them. We're heading into this new world with a regulatory system that's designed for technology that's much less sophisticated than what we're facing in the near future.\n\nTechnological innovation shouldn't be stopped, but it should be monitored and analyzed to make sure we don't move past a point of no return. This will require cooperation between the government and private industry to ensure that developing technologies can continue to improve our lives without destroying them. We need a federal government department, with a cabinet-level secretary, that is in charge of leading technological regulation in the 21st century. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Technology is developing faster than government can analyze the impact and enforce regulations.\n- Even those developing technologies often have no idea what impact they have on humanity.\n- Human technical knowledge is quickly reaching the point where there are many existential threats that could develop without us fully understanding said threat. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Monitor the development of new technology\n- More quickly adapt to the changing technological landscape\n- Prevent technological threats to humanity from developing without oversight",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Create a new executive department - the Department of Technology - to work with private industry and Congressional leaders to monitor technological developments, assess risks, and create new guidance. The new Department would be based in Silicon Valley and would initially be focused on Artificial Intelligence. \n- Create a new Cabinet-level position of Secretary of Technology who will be tasked with leading the new Department. \n- Create a public-private partnership between leading tech firms and experts within government to identify emerging threats and suggest ways to mitigate those threats while maximizing the benefit of technological innovation to society."

            "Robo-calling has become somewhere between an irritation and harassment for millions of Americans.  Companies have determined that the cost of a robo-call is zero so if even a handful generate sales leads they pay off.  This has led to many of us tuning out our phones and regarding people reaching out to us with suspicion as we pick up to hear an automated voice pitching us something we don't need. \n\nOur attention is valuable, and companies that occupy it should be improving our lives.  If they are simply wasting our time there needs to be some disincentive or deterrent. \n\nAs President, I will initiate a robo-calling text line.  If you receive a robo-call that you feel was a waste of your time, simply forward the number that called you to our robo-call investigations line.  The FCC will follow up with the company that called you.  If the FCC receives numerous complaints about a particular company, they will issue significant fines.  This will quickly discourage companies from adopting marketing tactics that customers find unpleasant or unwelcome. ",
            "## Problems to be Solved\n\n- Robo-calls are increasingly frequent given that they cost next to nothing for the companies who are calling.\n- There is no accessible means for an individual citizen to register a complaint and decrease incoming calls. \n- There is no disincentive for increasingly aggressive marketing tactics that erode our accessibility and empathy. ",
            "## Goals\n\n- Provide a disincentive to excessive robo-calling by companies\n- Maintain our receptivity to genuine outreach\n- Introduce increased accountability to firms",
            "## As President I will...\n\n- Initiate a Robo-calling Text Line to which all citizens can forward any number that makes a marketing call that they found offensive or a waste of time. \n- The FCC would investigate any complaints and levy significant fines to repeat offenders."
