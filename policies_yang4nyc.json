            "We need a New York Police Department (NYPD) that is focused on protecting New Yorkers. A high-functioning police force that serves racial justice goals is the aim. That requires top-down and bottom-up reform. We need accountability at every level - accountability when the NYPD fails to solve crimes, and accountability when officers engage in misconduct and violate New Yorkers' civil rights. New York City taxpayers now pay [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://abcnews.go.com/US/millions-lawsuit-settlements-hidden-cost-police-misconduct-legal/story?id=70999540) a year in civil settlements - funds that can be far better spent on our schools, parks, mass transit, and affordable housing.",
            "The [NYPD right now](https://cbcny.org/research/seven-facts-about-nypd-budget) has about 36,000 officers, nearly 20,000 civilian employees, and a budget of around $10 billion. Several oversight agencies - such as the Civilian Complaint Review Board - are tasked with ensuring the NYPD is complying with the law and treating all New Yorkers equitably. Given the size of this bureaucracy, real change will require years of sustained effort. ",
            "At the same time, good police officers need to feel supported. Violent crime is [rising](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/nyregion/nyc-2020-crime-covid.html), as are certain [hate crimes](https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/2/11/22279407/anti-asian-hate-crime-surge-fuels-demands-for-systemic-and-sensitive-responses), and we need officers to protect against any further increase. As such, it isn't enough to solely penalize officers engaged in misconduct. Officers are frequently put in traumatic situations and the City must ensure they feel supported after appropriately responding to dangerous incidents.",
            "Ultimately, a Yang administration will seek to reorganize the NYPD to rebuild trust between officers and New Yorkers, particularly communities of color, to refocus the NYPD on crimes that matter, and to ensure New York recovers not as it was, but how it deserves to be - a safe City firmly grounded in equality and respect.",
            "### Create a Deputy Mayor for Public and Community Safety with a direct line to the Mayor.",
            "Currently there are multiple City agencies with oversight of the criminal justice system and community safety across the continuum of violence prevention to reentry - the NYPD, the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ), the New York City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), the Department of Probation (DOP), the Department of Correction (DOC), and countless agencies with law enforcement embedded in them - from Homeless Services to the Department of Education. As a result, we lack a citywide strategy for violence prevention, violence interruption and responding to violence after it has occurred. A Yang administration will ensure that New York City has one coordinated response to keeping New Yorkers safe. By appointing a Deputy Mayor for Public and Community Safety, Andrew Yang will ensure that the City has a coordinated strategy at the highest level of City government.",
            "### Appoint a Police Commissioner with a background beyond NYPD experience.",
            "Andrew Yang will appoint a NYPD commissioner whose career is not primarily in law enforcement. A commissioner will need to be able to advance the culture and support a vision for how the NYPD can be fully integrated into a larger public safety strategy. The commissioner must have a broad perspective of the NYPD's role in New York and establish clear measures of policing success. That means refocusing the NYPD to protect against and solve violent crimes throughout the City while continuing to evolve.",
            "### Pursue a residency requirement for new officers in Albany.",
            "A majority of NYPD officers [live outside NYC](https://gothamist.com/news/majority-nypd-officers-dont-live-new-york-city-new-figures-show). NYPD officers are exempted from residency requirements and are allowed to live in nearby suburban counties, such as Suffolk County, even though NYC municipal workers are required to live in the five boroughs, including civilian workers in the NYPD. A Yang administration will seek state approval to repeal this carveout so that all new officers are required to live in New York City. If we are committed to the ideals of neighborhood policing, we should have our police live in our neighborhoods. They should be a part of the civic fabric and understand the communities they protect and serve. ",
            "### Prevent the rise in hate crimes.",
            "Hate crimes have become an epidemic in New York City. Whether the rise in anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and anti-semitic crimes in recent years, or the rise in anti-Asian crimes since the pandemic, the NYPD must serve as true partners to the New York City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) to prevent hate crimes, targeting prevention efforts where misinformation and disinformation is spreading, proactively protecting houses of worship and neighborhoods that police intelligence determines to be at risk of heightened violence, encouraging communities to report hate violence without the fear of retribution, and full police engagement in arresting those who commit or conspire to commit acts of violence. ",
            "### Invest resources into neighborhoods stricken by gun violence and ensure crimes are being solved when they occur.",
            "In 2020, the City reported 1,531 shootings, nearly double the previous year's total. Shootings and the overall rise in crime are overwhelmingly concentrated in communities of color, which have been hit hardest by the pandemic. A 2020 report by the Center for Court Innovation, which studied the experience of young people of color who live in public housing [revealed](https://www.courtinnovation.org/about/announcements/gotta-make-your-own-heaven-guns-safety-and-edge-adulthood-new-york-city) that \"current public safety efforts, where law enforcement is the primary response to violent crime, exacerbate young people's sense of urban siege.\" The same study revealed that the majority of people who carry guns had had someone close to them shot--most often a close friend or family member. 88% percent of participants had been arrested, more than half before age 16--mostly for charges like marijuana possession, robbery, and fare beating; almost two-thirds had been incarcerated. Criminal records and poverty pushed some participants to alternative survival strategies like drug dealing or robbery, which sometimes involved carrying a gun.",
            "The NYPD must be an integral partner in solving the gun violence epidemic, but not the only solution. That means increasing cops on  the street - and around the subways  - at least  temporarily when there are spikes in serious crimes. ",
            "A Yang administration will also seek to ensure the NYPD is actually solving crimes. The clearance rate for murders [dropped 16%](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/opinion/nypd-crime-murder.html) between 2019 and 2020. In fact, a key way of [building trust](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/opinion/nypd-crime-murder.html) between communities and the police is for officers to show they are able to solve serious crimes. One way to do so is to bolster the detective ranks and ensure officers are not [simply staying in their cars](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-police-response-strangled-woman-brooklyn-20210208-fpvnvw7ifrc2pjhst2oipr5rrm-story.html) or behind their desks [instead of getting out](https://www.propublica.org/article/what-can-mayors-do-when-the-police-stop-doing-their-jobs) in the neighborhoods.",
            "In addition, in recent years, the City has scaled its support for Cure Violence and other gun violence intervention programs as some of our most important interventions in addressing the epidemic. The Cure Violence program recruits and supports trusted, credible community messengers to interrupt violence before it begins, and mediate conflict when it arises. A Yang administration will further scale up Cure Violence so that every precinct with significant gun violence is ultimately covered.",
            "When an incidence of gun violence occurs - be it between community members, at the hands of police, or in a domestic dispute - communities also need to be supported through the trauma that results. The Yang Administration will invest in coordinated responses by community based organizations, mental health providers and hospitals to violence and support restorative justice practitioners, following the innovative strategies of organizations like Common Justice.",
            "### Overhaul oversight of the NYPD.",
            "Following the NYPD's deplorable reaction to the protests over the summer, the City's independent Department of Investigations released a [series of recommendations ](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doi/reports/pdf/2020/DOIRpt.NYPD%20Reponse.%20GeorgeFloyd%20Protests.12.18.2020.pdf)about how to better conduct oversight of the NYPD in a real and meaningful way. A Yang administration would supplement disciplinary power from the NYPD Commissioner so that the CCRB or an independent disciplinary committee is able to make a final determination. However, that increased responsibility will require greater resources from the outside board. At present, the CCRB board is composed of members appointed by the Mayor, Council, Public Advocate, and NYPD Commissioner. These positions need to be full-time. ",
            "Further, a Yang administration would push to do away with the requirement that individuals have to physically go to the CCRB officers in Lower Manhattan for in-person interviews. Instead, they should have teams meet individuals in locations throughout the five boroughs that are more convenient. As it is, only about [one-half of civilian complaints](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/08/24/nypd-a24.html) are fully investigated.",
            "### Expanded mental health counseling for officers.",
            "According to some studies, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) affects [19 percent](http://www.nycrimecommission.org/pdfs/ccc-policeforces-to-policeservices.pdf) of police in the US, 24 and 34 percent suffer from symptoms associated with PTSD. Under a Yang administration, new officers will automatically receive regular counseling for the first two years of their service. As officers respond to dangerous and traumatic experiences for the first time, it is essential they are able to appropriately emotionally cope with the stresses of their profession.",
            "### Expand our capacity for a mental health response.",
            "*Expand mental health co-response teams*",
            "In 2017, New York City reported that there were 169,000 mental health emergency 911 calls were received by the NYPD in 2017 - approximately one call every three minutes, were made by people needing help and where there was no indication of violence. The majority (56%) of these calls result in the individual being transported to the hospital, highlighting the need for partnership between law enforcement and public health workers. In February 2021, the NYPD is [expanding co-response teams](https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/773-20/new-york-city-new-mental-health-teams-respond-mental-health-crises), sending social workers out with police officers, specifically to respond to 911 calls of people who are in mental health distress. This program is based on similar models in Eugene, OR and Denver, CO that have reduced police response to people in mental health distress overall, and should be expanded citywide. ",
            "*Invest in the capacity of a Mental Health Emergency Response Unit*",
            "The NYPD does not have the capacity nor skill set to respond to many people in emotional distress or who are experiencing mental health crises, particularly those in the disability community for whom interacting with law enforcement is difficult. We are encouraged to see the [recent announcement](https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/773-20/new-york-city-new-mental-health-teams-respond-mental-health-crises) by the City that for the first time, mental health professionals and crisis workers will be dispatched through 911 to respond to mental health emergencies. A Yang administration would scale this pilot program up so that it expands beyond the current two high-need communities in which it is set to begin operating February 2021. As we expand the pilot we should continue to model our system off the CAHOOTS (Crisis Assistance Helping out On The Streets) program in Eugene, Oregon, which has [diverted 5-8% of calls](https://www.eugene-or.gov/4508/CAHOOTS) from the police. ",
            "### Auditing the use of surveillance technologies.",
            "Investigative reporting revealed the broad use of facial recognition by the NYPD. To date, there are no real guidelines around the use of how new surveillance technologies should be used. The Council took an important first step by [passing the POST Act](https://council.nyc.gov/press/2020/06/16/1984/), which required disclosure of the NYPD's use of these technologies and an annual audit following the development of policies of such tools. A Yang administration will then look to develop policies around the findings that carefully balances their benefits in preventing and solving crimes with the need to protect our civil liberties.",

            "As we work to engage in the necessary repairs to our public housing, the Yang administration will invest in innovative solutions to create affordable housing across the City. This includes allowing communities to lead the charge in creating rezoning and development plans so that communities maintain their identity while expanding our affordable housing stock. Community Land Trusts (CLTs) can be proactively supported, with City Hall not just allocating funds to them but prioritizing them for land acquisition and the allocation of vacant public lots. Embracing co-living and allowing for single-room occupancy (SRO) living spaces will allow individuals to find housing that works for their lives and their budget.",

For the first time, there are more empty rooms than there are homeless families.

COVID-19 has only exacerbated racial and economic disparities that were already ever-present in a city with marked inequality.",
            "Well before COVID-19, by [the City's own calculations](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/opportunity/pdf/20_poverty_measure_report), 19.1% of New Yorkers lived in poverty - and 41.3% of New Yorkers were at risk of falling into poverty. The pandemic has exacerbated this economic reality, especially for New Yorkers of color and immigrant New Yorkers, who have been hardest hit by the pandemic and are left out of state or federal relief.",
            "Our City is hurting - employment is scarce, people experiencing homelessness see a long road to permanent affordable housing, and members of our community returning home from incarceration have minimal support to get on their feet. But still, the resiliency of our City is what defines us. The promise of the five boroughs -- that you can be born in a City hospital, get a world-class public education, attend a City university, get a great job with benefits to support your family, and find a permanent, affordable place to live -- is the story of so many New Yorkers. This is the New York we want back. **As we recover from COVID, we must reinvest in New Yorkers who have systematically been left behind.**",
            "Second only to housing subsidies, direct cash transfers and tax credits are the most critical components in helping families make ends meet.",
            "**A Yang administration will launch the largest basic income program in the country. Through this program, 500,000 New Yorkers with the greatest need will receive a basic income that will help give them a path forward. Our goal is to end extreme poverty in New York City by putting cash relief directly into the hands of those who desperately need help right now, ensuring that every household has an annual income that is at least above extreme poverty, taking into account the true cost of living in New York City.**",
            "**This basic income program will start with providing those who are living in extreme poverty with an average of $2,000 per year. This program can then be grown over time as it receives more funding from public and philanthropic organizations, with the vision of eventually ending poverty in New York City altogether.**",
            "[As studies of basic income programs have shown](https://basicincome.stanford.edu/uploads/Umbrella%20Review%20BI_final.pdf), lifting people up from the depths of poverty increases mental and physical health while decreasing crime. It increases happiness and satisfaction while reducing stress. It gets the economic boot off of people's throats, allowing them to lift their heads up, breathe, and get excited for the future. By reducing crime, hospital visits, and homelessness, this basic income program will decrease the costs associated with these social ills and allow the cash relief program to grow over time.",

            "In 2014, New York launched the largest municipal ID program in the country - IDNYC. Currently, a physical identification card helps New Yorkers who do not currently have an ID card get one. IDNYC will become one physical platform through which New Yorkers can obtain cash relief. IDNYC cards, which already allow New Yorkers to open a bank account at select banks and credit unions in New York City, will be adopted for this program to serve as an enrollment tool.",
            "A Yang administration will also create the People's Bank of New York City. New Yorkers who receive this basic income automatically become participants in the People's Bank, and cash will be directly transferred to participants in their accounts every single month. Of course, New Yorkers who already have other accounts can opt to receive the basic income there.",
            "In total, New Yorkers receiving cash relief can simultaneously receive an IDNYC card, with all of the same benefits of the current IDNYC program, and sign up for an account with the People's Bank of New York City.",

            "Upon assuming office, the Yang administration will engage in targeted outreach efforts in the neighborhoods with the lowest area median income (AMI), and among New Yorkers who are in greatest need of cash relief, to ensure that New Yorkers who would potentially benefit most from this basic income program enroll.",
            "This program will be administered by the New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA), the agency already charged with enrolling New Yorkers in a range of benefits and services, with the oversight and support of the Mayor's Center for Economic Opportunity, which issues an annual analysis of poverty in the five boroughs.",

            "The [bill](http://takebacknyc.nyc/sbjsa) has been around for over a decade, but its salience only continues to grow. Already, a majority of Council members support the bill, and the time is ripe to pass it. It protects small business owners during lease renegotiations so that landlords can't hold them hostage for higher rents from others or for a piece of the business that the owners grew. By providing small business owners with the right to a 10-year renewal, these entrepreneurs will be able to have much-needed stability and needed foresight to trust that NYC is a worthwhile investment and a sound value proposition.",
            "### Push NYS for a Vacancy Tax.",
            "There are too many open storefronts in NYC. A Yang administration would advocate New York State for a vacancy tax, determining an amount of time for which a storefront can be vacant, after which the landlord must pay a tax to the state as a penalty. This will create an incentive for them not to leave retail spaces empty in the hopes of waiting for a tenant who will pay higher rent. The money could also go towards minority- and women-owned enterprise development. In 2020, San Francisco passed a [vacancy tax](https://therealdeal.com/2020/03/16/san-francisco-passed-a-tax-on-vacant-storefronts-what-does-that-mean-for-nyc/) with 70% of the vote and the Council passed a bill requiring the city to build a database of vacancies.",
            "### Create a permanent low- or no-interest loan program.",

Through the People's Bank of NYC, low- or no-interest loans could be offered to small businesses that meet certain criteria. Public Advocate [Jumaane Williams](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4579090&GUID=4FD26FAD-7DE1-49FA-8CD2-DDEC4B1FC7F8&Options=Advanced&Search=) has proposed a program for small businesses, nonprofits, and freelancers hit by the pandemic. COVID has created a cash crunch that could force many small businesses to close. We can help relieve that.",
            "### Renew licenses and permits without fee or application.",
            "We should strive to make licensing and permitting painless. We can make the Open Storefronts program (allowing ground-floor businesses to conduct business/retail on outdoor areas) permanent. We can automatically renew sidewalk cafe licenses for licensees that have been previously approved. This will help small businesses while creating a unique feel for each neighborhood.",
            "### Contract with minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs).",
            "Despite the city's diversity, NYC has a long history of failing to contract with MWBEs. The pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on MWBEs, with Black-owned businesses seeing [more than twice the closure rate](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/minority-and-women-owned-businesses-at-risk-impact-of-covid-19-on-new-york-city-firms/) of white-owned ones.[ ](https://www.yangforny.com/policies/relief-for-our-small-businesses)We should make it easier for MWBEs to get government contracts by overhauling the certification process for MWBEs; breaking up bigger contracts into smaller, more manageable chunks; targeting a doubling of procurement awards to MWBEs by 2025 (current level is at [4.9%](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/making-the-grade/reports/making-the-grade-2020/)); and appointing a former MWBE owner as next head of the MWBE Office.",
            "### Foster a solidarity economy and support worker cooperatives.",
            "We should expand on the Worker Cooperative Business Development Initiative (WCBDI) and Employee Ownership NYC by developing specific resources for how businesses can transition to a more online-based economy (i.e., e-commerce and ghost kitchens). We can facilitate co-op incubators and trainings in each borough by supporting organizations such as the [Green Worker Cooperatives](http://www.greenworker.coop/) in the Bronx and help groups connect with vacant office, retail and manufacturing space as needed.",
            "### Extend the cap on food delivery services.",
            "Food delivery apps have traditionally taken upwards of 30% of an order - that's money taken away from a local, small business and going straight to another state. As restaurants are forced to shift their business to online ordering, this fee is killing their bottom lines and making it more difficult for them to operate. The City Council passed a bill limiting the fee to 20% (15% commission and 5% of other fees) until 90 days after the resumption of indoor dining. This should be extended even after that time, as restaurants typically have margins in the 10% range and these fees were already unmanageable.",

            "85% of NY non-profits say COVID has had a [significant impact](https://www.nycon.org/storage/documents/Documents_for_Linking/NYCON_2020_Covid-19_Survey_Report_FINAL.pdf) on their operations.

That's unacceptable and we will guarantee payment within 30 days. The City will pay its partners, vendors, and suppliers promptly. It is better situated to handle cash flow issues than its vendors are. A Yang Administration will forgive [missed performance metrics](https://www.thecity.nyc/coronavirus/2020/3/16/21210436/nonprofits-ask-city-hall-to-cut-red-tape-threatening-aid) through 2022 and can revise contracts thereafter.",
            "### Create local business spending vouchers.",
            "This year, some countries began distributing consumption coupons, a type of [voucher via e-payment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-29/china-hands-out-vouchers-to-get-people-shopping-after-lockdown?sref=Axwumxmw) to stimulate local spending. The requirements usually include a minimum spend and are often targeted at restaurants, supermarkets and other outlets hit hard by the pandemic. The system varied by city. One model saw the local government releasing five rounds of [electronic consumer coupons](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-consumption-coupons-boost-domestic-retail-recovery-coronavirus-shutdown-ends/) valid for seven days before expiring. All residents were eligible for one coupon packet per week valued at ~$7, distributed through five separate vouchers. We should create a voucher program of our own, subsidizing discounts for purchases at local establishments - use your vouchers and get a certain percent off your purchases from local businesses.",
            "### Allow for land swaps and pop-ups throughout a neighborhood.",
            "Small businesses and restaurants that had the desire and resources to move out into the public realm this summer were often prevented from doing so by things like fire hydrants or bus stops in front of their location. By looking at the neighborhood scale for [land swap](https://nycfuture.org/research/surviving-the-winter-nyc-small-business) opportunities, restaurants could move into or in front of the vacancy next door or nearby.",
            "### Crowdsource donations for small businesses (based on London's Pay it Forward).",
            "NYC should have a consolidated app for many reasons, but one is to allow for crowdsourcing for NYC small businesses with matching donations. This could focus on coops, bars and restaurants, allowing them to keep themselves afloat until they're free to fully open again. Londoners raised [PS1.5 million](https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/more-than-1-5-million-raised-for-small-businesses-through-pay-it-forward-campaign/) to support hundreds of businesses through a similar program, and there's no reason NYC can't do the same.",

            "New York's top philanthropies and financial institutions should allocate more resources and a larger proportion of their endowments to local causes. Big banks should be a partner with the People's Bank and give out low-interest loans to businesses struggling to survive. They should also invest in neighborhoods traditionally overlooked. And local tech firms can donate their time to build out the NYC App that will allow for our own Akron- or London-style system to be built. And, lastly, large landlords should provide space for pop-ups and temporary programming to support the arts and fashion. It's time to use the government to create these unique partnerships between businesses, individuals, and communities in order to rebuild this City.",
            "### Support Cinch Market and other local e-commerce efforts to compete with Amazon.",
            "[A new company](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/08/08/the-website-that-let-s-local-brooklyn-businesses-compete-against-amazon) is bringing together local businesses in Brooklyn to offer a Prime-like delivery service. We can offer to directly invest in this company or in others looking to expand to the other boroughs. Similarly, we can help set up a local app for restaurants to take orders, or to create a centralized directory of local businesses. This could also provide jobs, as delivery workers could be hired at a livable wage through this service with almost no delivery fees incurred by the restaurants.",
            "### Buy regulated hardware - such as outdoor heaters - in bulk, and then sell them to local businesses.",
            "There has been a lot of confusion about which heaters to buy, and the market in general has been tight. Many restaurants also couldn't afford the unexpected expense. By buying complying heaters, or other hardware that is subject to City regulations, in bulk and providing them at cost to restaurants, NYC can help these small businesses expand their offerings. [DC spent $4 million](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2020/09/21/dc-patio-dining-grants.html) on a program like this (grants to businesses to winterize rather than bulk purchasing) to great effect.",

Crumbling infrastructure, a backlog of repairs, rampant mold and lead poisoning have resulted in health problems, psychological strain and poor quality of life for NYCHA residents. Compared to the city average, NYCHA apartments have twice the rate of cockroach infestations, heating breakdown, broken toilets, and water leakages making NYCHA residents twice as likely as the average New Yorker to face health challenges. As mayor, Andrew Yang's top priority will be securing $48 billion in needed funding from the federal government over the next 10-years to make repairs and capital improvements, ensuring that all improvements to the system are aligned with environmental standards.",

            "### A Full Capital Investment in NYCHA",
            "**A Yang administration will fight for $48 billion for NYCHA for capital repairs from the federal government.** The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) has struggled through decades of disinvestment. Expected repair costs now total $32 billion over five years and $46 billion over 20 years. A Yang administration would use its deep relationships in Washington, DC, **to fight for at least $48 billion in funding** to cover NYCHA's full capital need and set NYCHA back on track while also investing in local solutions to make repairs and improve standards of care for public housing tenants.",

Although NYCHA does not face the same penalties as other landlords if it does not comply with the law, NYCHA can still lead on progressive decarbonization efforts. This includes passive house standards, energy and water efficiency, electrification of fossil-fuel based heating systems and investments in renewable energy and clean jobs.",
            "Here's the plan:",
            "**Abolish NYCHAs carbon pollution** by eliminating gas from all NYCHA buildings, reducing energy use, and procuring electricity from 100% renewable sources. A [Data for Progress Report](https://www.filesforprogress.org/reports/green-new-deal-public-housing-nycha.pdf) indicates that these actions \"would cut NYCHA's annual carbon emissions to zero by 2030 -- a 2.3 million ton reduction of carbon per year, which is equivalent to taking 453,243 cars off the road.\"",
            "**Accelerate deep energy retrofits** such as upgrades to windows, the building's outer cladding and its core energy systems, which would also reduce multiple drivers of mold and pest infestation. This will require appliance upgrades such as heat pumps, new stoves, leak-proof low-flow toilets, and new fridges (though NYCHA has made some progress on turning over toilets and fridges already).",
            "**This will have major impacts in terms of cost savings.** Smart retrofits will both improve resident quality of life and help NYCHA realize dramatic utility savings overtime that would improve NYCHA's long term financing.  Other cities, which began retrofitting over a decade ago, such as [Toronto](https://www.torontohousing.ca/Pages/TowerWise-Retrofit-Project.aspx), [Boston](http://archive.boston.com/lifestyle/green/articles/2010/03/18/a_63m_push_to_retrofit_housing/) and [Paris](https://www.c40.org/case_studies/c40-good-practice-guides-paris-public-private-co-management-espc-for-schools-retrofits) have realized 20-40% carbon emission reductions that resulted in energy savings in their public housing developments. New York City can do this too. **Estimates show that a Green New Deal for NYCHA would save 35-70% of current energy costs, realizing $100 to $398 million a year in savings.**",
            "**And, retrofit purchases can harness the market power of the public sector, reducing costs for others.** As Data for Progress points out, \"bulk public purchases of the best new appliance models could drive down costs for everyone in the market as well. Other public agencies or community groups could also piggy-back on these bulk purchases to secure low-cost appliances for their members.\" And, there's precedent for city government using its convening power to lead product development and bolster demand for new technology. For example, in the 1990s NYCHA and the New York Port Authority did just that with a [contest to find](https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/1996/data/papers/SS96_Panel2_Paper19.pdf) an efficient refrigerator model, which resulted in Maytag producing the first Energy Star fridge sized for apartment living.",
            "**We will commit to putting solar on every NYCHA roof by 2030:** NYCHA buildings are a clear candidate because they have flat/exposed roofs with no mechanical equipment because none of the buildings are centrally cooled. Eventually all energy will come from zero-carbon sources like wind and solar.",
            "**Provide \"Cooling As a Right\" to every NYCHA resident -- \"**Heating as a right\" is a requirement in all NYC buildings. As the climate warms and we experience more heat waves, every resident should have access to air-conditioning in their home. Last summer, the administration began efforts to reach out to NYCHA tenants under the city's Get Cool NYC Program, which was slated to deliver 22,000 ACs to NYCHA residents. As of June 2020, 1,900 units were installed in NYCHA buildings. Electric heat pumps, which will be installed to replace natural gas and oil steam boilers will provide both heating and cooling.",
            "### Invest in Clean Jobs and Economic Development",
            "**A Green New Deal will create up to 325,519 jobs in NYC over ten years**, which according to Data for Progress, would result in a citywide economic impact of up to $96 billion in local economic activity over a decade. Priority for installation training and jobs will be given to NYCHA residents for these high-skilled, high-paid, union jobs.",
            "**A Yang administration would also invest in job training for NYCHA residents, especially in green jobs.** [Green City Force](https://greencityforce.org/service-corps/farms-at-nycha/) has done incredible work to engage young people who live at NYCHA and are out of school and out of work. They provide critical professional development and apprenticeship-style training to rehabilitate developments, with a focus on energy efficiency and access to food. These are exactly the programs we should be connecting young people to after this trying time and are generously funded by private groups and City dollars. A Yang administration will work with philanthropists to expand this funding and bring these resources to as many NYCHA developments as possible.",
            "### Rid NYCHA of Mold and Lead",
            "**Create a healthy and safe home for every NYCHA resident.** Federal and city law requires NYCHA conduct mandatory safety inspections for lead paint and submit documentation to HUD showing compliance with the law. But, in 2017, the Department of Investigations (DOI) released a [damning report](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doi/press-releases/2017/nov/27NYCHALeadPaint11-14-2017_UL.pdf) confirming that NYCHA had been lying for years about its lead paint inspections and actually was falsely certifying its compliance in documents to HUD. This has put thousands of children at great risk.",
            "We continue to witness the irresponsibility and toll this has taken on children, mostly of color, who reside in NYCHA. By completely eliminating the root cause of mold, a Green New Deal for NYCHA would reduce the high rate of asthma among [NYCHA residents by 18-30%](https://www.filesforprogress.org/reports/green-new-deal-public-housing-nycha.pdf), allowing residents to see increased health benefits, which will save lives and the city money in healthcare costs.",
            "That is why a Yang administration supports the creation of a mold Ombudsperson. As a result of ongoing litigation, a federal judge has appointed an Ombudsperson to assess NYCHA tenants' complaints about leak, mold and excess moisture repair orders. Because the Ombudsperson has the power to compel NYCHA to make repairs, it is an effective tool, but the court order expires in 2021. A Yang administration would follow this model by appointing a permanent independent Ombudsperson with legal authority to investigate, bring charges and compel repairs. More than this, residents need to know the Ombudsperson exists. Our administration will dedicate resources to conduct tenant outreach, ensuring that all NYCHA residents utilize this enforcement tool to their advantage.",

            "The last year has been tough for almost all businesses, but New York's world class restaurants, bars and nightlife have been hit especially hard. In an [audit conducted by the State Comptroller](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/pdf/nyc-restaurant-industry-final.pdf), the next year could see as many as one-third of New York City's bar and restaurants close, resulting in the loss of as many as 12,000 city restaurant jobs and 159,000 industry jobs. The City must remove obstacles for these industries wherever possible and commit to clear regulations with open-line of communications to support businesses reopening as effortlessly as possible.",
            "### Call for immediate federal relief for restaurants.",
            "As an immediate measure, Andrew Yang also supports  calls from the industry, including the NYC Hospitality Alliance to pass the bipartisan federal RESTAURANTS Act of 2021 to bring much needed funds to foodservice businesses.",
            "Yang also supports proposals to help generate revenue for restaurants and bars while facilitating safe practices. To that end he stands with the [NYC Hospitality Alliance](https://thenycalliance.org/information/employment-numbers-and-testimony-on-covid-19) in calling for the following proposals:",
            "### Convert Sales Tax collected by restaurants and bars into grants.",
            "This temporary measure is a necessary way to get cash into the hands of businesses who desperately need it. The city should agree to forego sales tax collected by eating and drinking establishments until the state of emergency is lifted.",
            "### Halt the Commercial Rent Tax.",
            "Commercial rent tax is an effective 3.9% surcharge on rent exceeding a certain threshold for Manhattan businesses south of 96th St. Now is not the time to leverage taxes on the backs of struggling businesses.",
            "### Provide PPE to all restaurants free of charge and prioritize hospitality workers for the COVID-19 vaccine.",
            "PPE saves lives and is a crucial way to keep workers and customers safe. We cannot ask those in the hospitality industry to work unless they are safe.",
            "### Buy regulated hardware -- such as outdoor heaters, dividers and air filtration systems -- in bulk and then sell them to local businesses.",
            "There has been a lot of confusion about which heaters to buy, and the market in general has been tight. Many restaurants could not afford the unexpected expense. By buying complying heaters, or other hardware that is subject to City regulations, in bulk and providing them at a reduced cost to restaurants, NYC can help those small businesses expand their offerings. For example, [Washington D.C](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2020/09/21/dc-patio-dining-grants.html). spent $4 million on a program to help restaurants winterize their establishments to great effect. Furthermore, the certification and regulations around outdoor heaters are a major obstacle for restaurants to partake in outdoor dining. The city should work with the FDNY to streamline applications and adjust regulations while continuing to prioritize safety.",
            "### Incentivize creative space usage amongst commercial neighbors.",
            "Throughout the pandemic, some retailers and other establishment owners who did not have use for the outdoor space in front of their businesses, lent their curb space to their neighborhood restaurants. We should capitalize on this good will and provide a system to streamline this lending so that it is increased and the lenders are protected. Andrew Yang supports Tim Tompkins' of the Times Square Alliance proposal to **incentivize owners of vacant storefronts to \"lend\" their outdoor vacant spaces to adjacent businesses,** such as restaurants. Tompkins suggests the \"city should institute a 150% current or future tax credit to the landlord \"lending\" the space, meaning that a landlord would receive a 45-day-value-tax credit for a 30-day lease. In order to facilitate transactions, the city should work with a landlord group to develop a temporary sublease that addresses the kinds of standard concerns that come up about liability, electricity use, and insurance.\" In addition, sublessors should have the right to charge rent as part of these leases so that both retail establishments can benefit from the increased activity as we all work to pull out of this crisis together.",
            "### Immediately renew all licenses and permits.",
            "As discussed above, we **must cut red tape and reduce regulatory** burdens on all small businesses. That is why a Yang administration will **immediately renew all licenses and permits** for the first year of its administration to make it possible for business owners to focus on running their business, not dealing with city bureaucracy.",
            "### Build upon the outdoor dining momentum.",
            "One major success in an otherwise miserable year was our **great experiment with outdoor dining**. Over 10,000 restaurants participated in outdoor dining (which the city estimated has [saved over 100,000 jobs](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-makes-outdoor-dining-permanent-for-restaurants-2020-9)), and many New Yorkers reported that adding tables to sidewalks and parking spaces helped foster a stronger sense of neighborhood community. In September, the Mayor announced the program will be extended permanently and year round. We strongly support this initiative and will update the city code to ensure this measure is a **permanent fixture of our neighborhoods.**",
            "### Advocate the state loosen restrictions on carry-out alcohol beverages.",
            "Another success during the pandemic was to-go cocktails. As mayor, **Andrew Yang will work to make Governor Cuomo's executive order relaxing the state's restrictions on carry-out or delivered alcohol permanently.** Easing these restrictions was a lifeline for bars (which employ almost [16,000 New Yorkers](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/pdf/nyc-restaurant-industry-final.pdf)) as well as restaurants. Margins in foodservice are razor-thin, and alcohol sales can make or break a restaurant. Allowing to-go drinks doesn't mean making NYC the next Bourbon Street. Our administration will continue to enforce existing rules around safety and quality of life while loosening onerous restrictions on small businesses.",
            "### Enable restaurants to have ownership of customer data.",
            "In a 21st century economy, data is paramount. But when a customer orders from a local restaurant, their information often does not go to the restaurant, it's controlled by the third party delivery service. A Yang administration will champion legislation that will require third-party apps to give restaurants ownership of their customer data and analytics. By giving business owners power over their customer base, they will have access to an invaluable tool to control their own fate through improving their marketing and services to consumers.",
            "### Support the City Council's efforts to expand the cap charged by food delivery apps.",
            "A Yang administration will also expand on the City Council's emergency efforts to reduce burdens on restaurants by **making the cap on delivery fees permanent.** Food delivery apps have traditionally taken upwards of 30% of an order - that's money taken away from a local, small business and going straight to another state. As restaurants are forced to shift their business to online ordering, this fee is killing their bottom lines and making it more difficult for them to operate. The City Council passed a bill limiting the fee to 20% (15% commission and 5% of other fees) until 90 days after the resumption of indoor dining. This should be extended even after that time, as restaurants typically have margins in the 10% range and these fees were already unmanageable.",

            "### The COVID Achievement Gap",
            "The challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic are extraordinary, particularly for our most vulnerable students. Here in New York City, 1.1 million public school students have struggled through the pandemic. With the abrupt transition to remote learning that did not [equip students fairly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/new-york-homeless-students-coronavirus.html), many low-income students and students of color did not -- and still do not -- have the technology and broadband access needed to access school lessons. One report [showed](https://gothamist.com/news/thousands-nyc-students-havent-connected-school-all-year-officials-say) that as many as 2,600 students were not engaged with either remote learning or in-person school in 2021.",
            "Even for students who were online, there has been significant [learning loss](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-to-gauge-students-learning-loss-during-pandemic-11607631234) in what has been termed the \"COVID achievement gap.\" One [report by Renaissance Learning Inc.](https://www.renaissance.com/2020/10/15/news-renaissance-answers-question-impact-covid-student-performance/), conducted nationally, found that students started this school year significantly behind in math and modestly behind in some grades in reading. According to the [Wall Street Journal's](https://www.wsj.com/articles/student-test-scores-drop-in-math-since-covid-19-pandemic-11605974400?mod=article_inline) recounting of the report, \"it would take students in grades five and six at least 12 weeks on average to catch up to where they were expected to be in the fall in math, compared with pre-pandemic skills.\" In a report [released by Mckinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Public%20and%20Social%20Sector/Our%20Insights/COVID-19%20and%20student%20learning%20in%20the%20United%20States%20The%20hurt%20could%20last%20a%20lifetime/COVID-19-and-student-learning-in-the-United-States-FINAL.pdf), it was revealed that students have learned just 87 percent of the reading and only 67 percent of the math that their grade-level peers learned during more typical years. Long-term effects of learning loss will also be evident in earnings. The report further emphasized that it is estimated that the average K-12 student will ultimately lose between $61,000 and $82,000 in lifetime earnings, as a result of school closures, with students of color experiencing a bigger setback than their White counterparts. These losses in earnings could lead to $483 billion lost in national GDP by 2040.",
            "### A Jobs Crisis for Young People",
            "At the same time, **recent high school and college graduates are facing the prospects of a daunting job market**, unsure of whether they can afford higher education and where to look to land a job.  According to a recent report in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/nyregion/nyc-unemployed-young-workers.html), \"no age group has had it worse than young workers. By September, 19 percent of adults under 25 in the city had lost jobs compared with 14 percent of all workers.\"",
            "Fortunately, these very young people, who find themselves in a precarious position, are also **eager to serve their communities, earn a living and build their resumes through public service**. In a [New York Times Op Ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/opinion/national-service-americorps-coronavirus.html) entitled \"We Need National Service. Now.\" columnist David Brooks wrote, \"there is a passionate, idealistic generation that sees the emergency, wants to serve those around them and groans to live up to this moment... The obvious imperative right now is to join workers with the work. It's to expand national service programs to meet the urgencies of the moment.\" A poll released on January 25, 2021 by the Serve America Together Campaign showed broad bipartisan support for the idea of national service and that 62% of respondents were very or somewhat likely to recommend a national service program to a young person they cared about.",
            "### Mobilizing 10,000 Tutors for New York City Students",
            "Leaders in Congress are embracing this vision. In April 2020, Senator Christopher Coons (D-Delaware) joined by a bi-partisan group of his Senate colleagues [introduced legislation](https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-significantly-expand-national-service-programs-to-respond-to-covid-19) to fund 750,000 national service positions to be used in helping the United States to recover from the pandemic. Under the bill, the federal AmeriCorps program would expand from 75,000 to 150,000 national service positions in the first year and double to 300,000 in years two and three. As Congress works to draft the $1.9 trillion \"American Rescue Plan,\" on February 22, 2021 the [House Education and Labor Committee](https://edlabor.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2021-02-08%20Budget%20Reconciliation%20Bill%20Fact%20Sheet%20FINAL.pdf) included a $1 billion boost in investment to the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), including AmeriCorps.",
            "### Tutoring Successfully Reverses Learning Loss",
            "Research shows high-dosage tutoring will be key to helping students recover their learning loss from the pandemic. According to a [study by Brown University](https://www.edworkingpapers.com/ai20-335) released in December, \"tutoring is among the most effective education interventions ever to be subjected to rigorous evaluation. The average effect of tutoring programs on student achievement is larger than the effects found in approximately 85% of studies evaluating education interventions and equivalent to moving a student at the 35th percentile of the achievement distribution to the 50th.\"",
            "### The Big Apple Corps",
            "As Mayor, Andrew Yang will mobilize 10,000 new tutors as part of a new initiative coordinated by the City, powered by AmeriCorps and supported by business & philanthropy: **The Big Apple Corps**. Each tutor serving as part of the **Big Apple Corps** will work with 10 students, thereby reaching 100,000 of the most vulnerable children in the five boroughs starting with Title I schools through coordination with local non-profits who already serve our hardest-hit communities. Assuming that a major expansion of the federal AmeriCorps program materializes as part of President Biden's COVID Relief package currently pending in Congress, a Yang administration will tap proven providers of tutoring to provide high-quality tutoring to children in Math and English Language Arts. Federal funding will provide the bulk of the financing for this initiative through the AmeriCorps program, which pays members a modest living allowance during their year of service as a tutor. A Yang administration will work to supplement any additional costs to increase the program beyond federal funding so participants can earn a real livable wage in the City of New York.",
            "### Academic, Social & Emotional Support",
            "The plan will provide students with one-on-one and small group tutoring throughout the academic year, offering enrichment opportunities and serving as mentors who will provide social-emotional support for students as they recover from missed instruction due to the pandemic. Academic tutoring is just one piece of any recovery effort for our students. Andrew Yang understands that students -- especially our most vulnerable -- have suffered through immense loss, trauma, social isolation and more. Utilizing the mentoring model of AmeriCorps is one way of addressing both  the academic and social-emotional needs of our students.",
            "### Larger Community Impact",
            "Additionally, the impacts of this proposal go beyond the immediate benefits to the students receiving the tutoring. Every $1 invested in national service produces [about $4 in benefits](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/opinion/national-service-americorps-coronavirus.html), not accounting for the emotional, social, psychological and career benefits accrued to those doing the serving, not just those who are being served.",
            "### Fostering Professional Development",
            "Experts and practitioners such as Alan Safran and AJ Gutierrez of Saga Education and Kim Dadisman of MIT have [written recently](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/539786-everyones-talking-about-a-national-tutoring-corps-heres-what-we) about not only the need for a national tutoring corps, but also \"ongoing coaching on how to be effective educators.\" We agree. That is why the Big Apple Corps will work with practitioners in the field to continually engage tutors for best practices and results on an ongoing basis, facilitating feedback and guidance on the tutors' performance so they get on-the-job feedback and support.",
            "### New York City Teachers Pipeline",
            "In addition, a Yang administration will support fellows' commitment to a **lifetime of public service, creating a pipeline for careers in education for program participants.** AmeriCorps is a valuable opportunity to invest in service-oriented young people who receive a first-hand look at what it is like to be a NYC teacher. We will work with these young people in turning this experience into an enduring career. The Segal AmeriCorps Education Award can go toward paying college loans or investing in a masters degree, but often these funds are not enough to cover the full cost of a degree. That is why we will work with institutional partners like CUNY to ensure cost is not an impediment to a quality education for the corps participants.",
            "### Inclusive Learning",
            "AmeriCorps promotes great teachers -- and great teachers are able to foster environments that are both inclusive and diverse. To bridge the particular gap that students with disabilities face, we must ensure that our tutors are receiving the best instruction for how to support students with disabilities. This program will train fellows in inclusive learning by encouraging both on-the-job training for supporting students with IEPs and, for those who opt in, options to attain a certification in teaching special education in the K-12 system. The East Harlem Teaching Residency, for example, provides a great model for how to develop, support and certify aspiring educators to become effective teachers in East Harlem; we should be investing in programs such as these to promote educational outcomes of our most disadvantaged communities and an equitable society.",

            "The borough now suffers from a severe lack of transportation investment, with the MTA and DOT both consistently deferring critical projects. We are a five borough City and need to invest accordingly. It's a key reason a Yang administration wants municipal control of the City's transit system -- so only the mayor is accountable for the success or failure of our transit system and that each borough and each neighborhood has more of a voice in transit planning in their neighborhood. Only a serious commitment, with a unified plan and single point of accountability, can lead to real boosts to mass transit, biking infrastructure, and restored and expanded ferry service.

Recently, the Department of Transportation failed to provide a [timeline](https://www.silive.com/coronavirus/2021/01/return-of-full-overnight-service-on-staten-island-ferry-remains-in-limbo.html) on when the previous service level, every 30 minutes, will be restored. This reduction has made commutes even more difficult for essential workers who are stocking shelves, providing medical care, and keeping the utilities running during the pandemic. This will also harm the livelihoods of New York's hospitality workers once the city's nightlife is restored. Andrew Yang is calling for ferry service to be restored this spring and he will maintain 30-minute service throughout his term.",

We will continue to expand express bus lanes throughout the City to build on this success and further speed up buses. Unlocking federal funding will be key to realizing these goals.",
            "In addition, the North and West Shore Bus Rapid Transit routes have been bandied about for years without ground being broken. First, [one of the two](https://new.mta.info/document/14016) West Shore routes needs to be chosen so the planning process can continue. Second, we need community input to decide whether the North Shore route makes sense. A Yang administration will then direct an environmental review, which was supposed to be completed this past fall. Staten Islanders need efficient ways to run errands and access the ferry.",
            "We will also seek to install bus shelters at each bus stop to provide a comfortable and dignified experience  for parents with children, older riders, and riders with disabilities. And of course, under a city-controlled transit system, all buses along these routes will be fully electric by 2030, which is a top commitment by the Yang campaign.",
            "### Focus on neighborhood improvements by filling potholes and expanding sidewalks.",
            "Far more streets on Staten Island need to have sidewalks. Residents shouldn't have to walk on the side of the road while cars fly by.

            "With limited access to inter-borough subway and bus services, Staten Islanders with disabilities have always relied on paratransit to connect them to the rest of the city. The MTA has reduced funding for the \"life-changing\" Access-A-Ride On-Demand E-hail pilot program - which allows some users to schedule rides immediately instead of having to wait a day in advance. The Yang Administration will look to build out that pilot so it works for disabled New Yorkers who need it.",

A bike lane would complete the 50-mile Harbor Ring path. Such connectivity for biking is essential to build out a comprehensive and interconnected network. A Yang administration will direct transit officials to consider different options, including how to keep the bridge secure for bikers and pedestrians in a way that is similar to the GWB, while guarding against increased traffic congestion.",

According to the New York Independent Venue Association ([NYIVA](https://www.nyiva.org/about)), NYC independent venues contribute $2.2 billion in economic output, and between $400- $500 million in tourism dollars. These are our local performing spots where so many of the greats got their start and where so many of our talented performers, musicians and artists come to share their work with New Yorkers and visitors. For nearly a year, these venues have been ordered to shut their doors with little to no guidance or support on how to stay afloat. Andrew Yang will invest in these cultural establishments and forge a collaborative working relationship in City Hall to ensure that, not only, they are able to thrive, but also that these cultural purveyors are leveraged as part of our city's revival.",

            "Independent venues and performers contribute greatly to our culture. But according to a NIVA survey, 90% of independent venues will close permanently in the next few months without funding support from the government, resulting in a loss of 16,000 jobs. Venues have no revenue, but continue to incur expenses including rent, utilities, fixed debt, payroll and licensing fees. What's worse is that many of these venues might not be able to access the federal Save our Stages funds and have been left out of other opportunities such as the NY [Pops-Up event initiative](https://nypopsup.com/), which feature many high-profile artists. **Andrew Yang supports NYIVA's call to the state to earmark 1.5% of the $5 billion Coronavirus Relief Funds (CRF) the state received from the March 30, 2020 CARES act --some of which is still unspent-- to create a $75 million fund to be used as a grant program and believes these funds should go toward live music venues, comedy clubs and nightlife establishments**. Criteria for accessing the funds should be recipients who have fewer than 500 full-time employees, are not publicly traded companies and were in operation in NYS for the 12 months of 2019. Allowable expenses should include payroll and benefits, rent, utilities, mortgage and/or loan payments, interest payments, insurance, PPE, health and safety upgrades, existing loans, payments to 1099 employees and other necessary business expenses. Event promoters and presenters should also be eligible for funds as they are a crucial part of the live performance ecosystem. Or, at the very least, with [as much as $70 billion](https://maloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/maloney-votes-to-deliver-70b-to-nys-passes-american-rescue-plan) in federal aid will shortly be coming to New York State, **the Governor and legislature should set aside $75 million this time to go directly to independent venues.** ",

But in recent years, the State Liquor Authority (SLA) has leaned heavily on a community board's recommendation on whether a bar, restaurant, cafe, or entertainment venue should get a liquor license. One major roadblock is a question on the [standardized notice form to a Community Board](https://sla.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/03/standardizednoticeform_02_28_2020.pdf), which requires that a venue indicate if they expect to host live music. This question is ostensibly asked to reduce noise and quality of life issues in the neighborhood; a worthy goal. However, there is little evidence that live music causes negative quality of life issues or would reach any higher decibel levels than prerecorded music, which is not subject to the same scrutiny. Live music is viewed by the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/music-is-a-vital-urban-resource-how-do-we-plan-for-it/) as a \"core urban indicator,\" as it has been found to promote economic growth and job creation. Music participation has substantial health benefits and is a significant social determinant of health. Live music [has also been found to be socially and culturally valuable to communities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026427511830996X#bb0100), promoting a sense of local identity and cultural vibrancy. These are the opportunities a Yang administration will fight to forge for performing artists, business owners and NYC residents. However, it is important to support communities and address their concerns when there are bad actors who negatively impact quality of life. To that end, Andrew Yang supports programs such as the [Mediating Establishment and Neighborhood Disputes (MEND)](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/mome/nightlife/mend-nyc.page) that provides free mediation and conflict resolution services to address neighborhood disputes.

In 2018, then City Council Member Rafael Espinal[ introduced legislation](https://www.documentjournal.com/2018/09/nyc-council-member-rafael-espinal-continues-to-improve-the-citys-nightlife-and-the-impact-it-leaves-behind/) called \"**the Agent of Change**\" that would require new nighttime establishments and new residential buildings that face commercial establishments be fitted with soundproof windows and walls or to cover the cost of their neighbors soundproofing, whichever is more financially feasible.

Yang agrees with the philosophy that artists are creative problem solvers. In 2019, only four artists were awarded this prestigious opportunity. A Yang administration will invest in this program to expand opportunities for artists and channel their creative problem solving abilities to the betterment of our city post-COVID-19.

A Yang administration will launch a music census in collaboration with a local university to study the health of the local music industry in New York and then create a comprehensive picture with the data, including policy recommendations to support musicians' recovery. Other cities such as [Austin](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Austin_Music_Census_Interactive_PDF_53115.pdf), [Pittsburgh](http://pghmusicproject.org/sites/default/files/2018_0711_smc_pittsburgh_digital.pdf) and [Washington D.C](https://thehoya.com/dc-music-census-reveals-large-local-musician-community). have executed on their own music census, which has helped study the climate of the industry, the needs of musicians, and contributed to public policy to support artists.",

            "In 2016, the City Council passed landmark legislation known as the Freelance Isn't Free Act, which guarantees freelance workers the right to a written contract, timely and full payment, and protection from retaliation. It also gives the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection's Office of Labor Policy and Standards (OLPS) the authority to investigate worker complaints and impose penalties and remedies on employers. These protections have been a model for the rest of the country and have done so much to safeguard independent workers. Andrew Yang will build on this legislation by **lowering the threshold to trigger a contract.** Currently under the law, contracts are only required for work with a fee of $800 or more. But we know that many freelancers take gigs for less than this. For example, a DJ performing at a music venue might charge less than $800 for her services per night, which means she is not entitled to the legal protections afforded by a contract for her work. We believe the threshold should be lowered to $250 to accommodate freelancers' needs and ensure they are always paid what they deserve. We also propose **lowering the required payment period on a contract from 30 to 15 days** and a required small down payment at the beginning of a job to ensure freelancers have a safety net from the start of the project.

Many people --particularly single adults and LGBTQ+ youth -- remain on our City's streets, seeking refuge where they can find it, which can often be unsafe and traumatic for people, especially those with mental health needs. The housing and economic fragility caused by the pandemic, a temporary pause in 24-hour train service and the increasing risk that shelters may present, have resulted in a far more visible crisis of street homelessness. This is unacceptable. A Yang administration will tackle homelessness head on.",

While single adult homelessness is also largely driven by a lack of affordable housing and/or domestic violence, some single adult homeless New Yorkers also need mental health services and/or substance use services. Supportive housing really is the proven solution for single adult homelessness, and rapidly increasing the supply is absolutely crucial to success in reducing the shelter census.

Our city spends tens of thousands of dollars to house people in shelter per year, rather than fully investing in the permanent, affordable housing that New Yorkers truly need. A Yang administration will ensure that there is a clear pathway to permanent affordable housing for New Yorkers who are currently living in shelter, with the access to the services that residents need within reach and will make the expansion of our affordable housing stock a priority.

            "- Focus on eviction protection and keeping people in their homes. \n- Reduce the length of stay in the shelter system by one-third in a year. Length of stay in shelters has increased by 76 percent since 2010 to an average of 431 days. Many individuals remain in shelter who could live independently if affordable housing existed.\n- Reduce the overall population and rate of return to shelter by 30% within two years.\n- Double the number of homeless outreach community centers so that New Yorkers have more immediate access to get food, clothing, internet access, showers and social services instead of living on the street and subways. Our centers will serve as a form of community outreach to the city's homeless population to help create trust and connection that will make the city's efforts more effective and compassionate. ",

Currently, no agency has the simple mandate to make sure that individuals stay housed. Through steady management, adhering to data-driven metrics, coordinated partnerships and accountability standards, Andrew Yang will make this goal the explicit mission of DHS. We must also bring a suite of city services to New Yorkers; wherever they are. Therefore all of our field offices will have services available to connect New Yorkers to jobs, housing vouchers, childcare and more. For example, if a person is visiting his or her ACS caseworker, they should also be able to gain assistance on applying for housing vouchers. These \"one-stop-shops\" will reduce bureaucracy and create effective experiences when navigating city services. Likewise, a Yang administration would establish a **** Clients Advisory Board under DHS made up of at least 40 shelter residents that span family shelters, single adults.

By providing incentives to share their savings with needy renters and by tying additional property tax relief to qualifying landlords who forgive rent that was unpaid during the COVID-19 covered period, the City can avoid a torrent of debt collections by landlords against cash strapped tenants and turn the TSHA and EEFPA into a stimulus for renters by keeping more money in tenant's pockets. Any property tax relief would be spread out over several years to prevent a hit to the City's coffers all at once, and would be targeted to small and medium sized landlords. ",
            "In addition, the Yang administration supports a reasonable extension of the current eviction moratorium on all evictions for any reason (currently set to expire on May 1, 2021) to prevent the COVID-19 Crisis from creating an eviction crisis.",
            "- **Expand Right to Counsel Citywide:** Access to a housing attorney is one of the surest ways that tenants who are taken to court by their landlords can remain in their homes. As New York City has piloted Right to Counsel and grown the Office of Civil Justice, 84% of tenants who had access to an attorney in housing court have been able to remain in their homes, and the eviction rate has declined by over 30 percent since the program's implementation began. A Yang administration will ensure that tenants in all five boroughs have access to a lawyer in housing court, expand the program so that more New Yorkers who make up to 400% of the Federal Poverty Line can access an attorney and ensure undocumented New Yorkers are eligible for this right. ",
            "- **Develop Strong Eviction Diversion Programs:** A Yang Administration will prevent eviction by encouraging efficient alternatives to housing court. All landlords pursuing rent non-payment cases against tenants will be given the option of  entering into an eviction diversion process where the City or City funded non-profit fit will match a tenant's repayment of rent owed if a landlord agrees to a reasonable repayment plan and forgoes eviction during the repayment period. Only tenants who fail to meet their payment obligation would face eviction. After a successful pilot, the Yang Administration will advocate for changes to State law to require eviction diversion before a landlord can evict for unpaid rent. The goal of the Eviction Diversion Program is to prevent evictions through a more collaborative process where tenants and landlord's engage to keep the tenant in their home with ongoing financial assistance.  While existing \"one shot deal\" programs provide financial assistance, tenants often obtain limited assistance very far into the eviction process, a disservice to both the tenant and landlord that maintains the cycle of non-payment and eviction. ",
            "- **Ramp up rent stabilization enforcement.** [There are about 1 million rent stabilized apartments in NYC](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/13/15264890/nyc-apartments-guide-tips-new-york) covering roughly 2.5 million tenants. At least 136,336 rent stabilized apartments have been lost since 2008. Yet recent investigations have found rampant abuses of 421a tax breaks and widespread illegal rent overcharges of rent stabilized apartments. Tenants pay more in rent than they should, and this  contributes to a cycle of evictions and abuse. New York City forgoes over $1.5 billion in tax revenue each year because of 421a - it is an expensive program and therefore should be properly enforced. The city and state are simply not enforcing rent stabilization laws, which puts good landlords at a competitive disadvantage. A Yang administration will create a new joint entity between HPD and the New York City Department of Finance (DOF) with the sole task of investigating compliance with state rent stabilization laws and revoking 421a tax exemptions from the greatest offenders. Tenant advocates like Housing Rights Initiative conduct these investigations when the city fails to. There should be no excuse for the city to not be doing this work.",
            "##### Reduce Street Homelessness in Half ",
            "- **Grow the number of safe haven beds:** The City's own HOPE count tells us that about 4,000 people are experiencing street homelessness. This is of course a point-in-time count, and not fully reflective of people who cycle in and out of street homelessness. Safe havens are a low-threshold option for people who need a place to stay, but are not willing to enter a traditional shelter. A Yang administration will grow the number of safe havens across the five boroughs from 1,200 to 4,000 to better accommodate the needs of people who are ready for a low-threshold option for a safe place to stay. A Yang administration will also expand the number of psychiatric beds by 20%. Read more about this in Andrew Yang's [Recovering from the Mental Health Impacts of COVID-19 ](https://www.yangforny.com/policies/recovering-from-the-mental-health-impacts-of-covid-19)plan.",
            "- **Grow capacity for supportive housing:**  Only one out of five shelter residents who have approved applications for supportive housing are placed because we lack the supply. Many New Yorkers are in need of comprehensive services which will allow them to transition out of shelter, but the city cannot produce supportive housing fast enough. Andrew Yang will accelerate the pace of New York City's commitment to build 15,000 supportive housing units in 15 years, focusing on meeting the needs of people who are in need of comprehensive case management and services. A Yang administration will also end the practice of providers selecting who can or cannot live in their buildings, and ensure that all potential residents are \"screened in,\" rather than screened out.",
            "- **Reform outreach efforts to build trust in the community**: Trust with and compassion towards the homeless population will be at the center of Andrew Yang's outreach efforts. Mayor Yang will divert law enforcement resources away from homeless outreach efforts and instead institute a human-centered approach where the city goes to homeless individuals to provide them with basic needs. The current practice of relying on law enforcement outreach has led to the over policing of homeless people in our city and a reduction in trust between the city and the homeless population. Our approach to outreach will be focused on creating trust between the homeless community and the city so that we can be effective at addressing the causes and effects of homelessness. ",
            "##### Create Immediate Pathways to Housing for People in Shelter",
            "- **Launch New Housing New York 25 (\"NHNY25\"), creating at least 25,000 new deeply affordable units, inclusive of supportive housing, using existing hotels that will not reopen:** Hotels can be converted into housing both economically and quickly.  No other vehicle can achieve results fast enough to demonstrate change early within a next administration.  A Yang Administration will provide regulatory relief and forgivable grants to eligible hotel properties entering into agreements with New York City for long term residential uses at affordable rents.  This new effort, New Housing New York, will allow for the conversion of some buildings, mainly hotels, and obsolete office buildings, throughout the City into tens of thousands of new units of housing.  By providing larger forgivable grants to owners or developers who agree to convert buildings into supportive housing and deeply affordable housing targeted toward people in the greatest need, this housing can take advantage of a once in a generation opportunity to create affordable housing for the New Yorkers who need it most. A Yang administration will create a minimum of 5,000 new units of housing in the first 18 months of the Administration, scaling up to 25,000 by 2025.",
            "- **Raise the allowance of city vouchers.** An important tool to reduce the shelter population in NYC is rental assistance programs. Unfortunately, the city's payment structure is substantially less than what landlords will accept. The city's rental assistance program, City Family Homeless and Eviction Prevention Supplement (\"CityFHEPS\") will only pay approximately $1,600 a month for a family of four while Federal Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers pays $2,000 a month. This difference results in landlords refusing to accept CityFHEPS vouchers while they wait for a  section 8 Voucher. It is unacceptable that due to a gap of a few hundred dollars a month, families are remaining in shelters which cost $6,000 a month. Andrew Yang will immediately move to make the city's rental assistance program equivalent to the section 8 standards. ",
            "- **Expand CityFHEPS to cover undocumented New Yorkers:** Undocumented New Yorkers are not eligible for FHEPS, and therefore linger in the shelter system with no pathway to affordable housing. Andrew Yang will work to ensure that immigration status is not an impediment to receiving city subsidies and will facilitate relationships of trust with immigrant New Yorkers and city agencies so that they do not have to be afraid when applying for city help. ",
            "- **End source of income discrimination:** New York City has among the most robust municipal human rights laws in the country. However, the New York City Commission on Human Rights is not able to keep up with the level of discrimination that renters with housing vouchers face when trying to find an apartment. A Yang administration will bolster the efforts of the New York City Commission on Human Rights to go after landlords who refuse to accept vouchers. ",
            "- **Urge the State to Pass Home Stability Support:** To help very low-income New Yorkers on the brink of homelessness or who are receiving certain government benefits, the Yang administration will urge the State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, the [Home Stability Support Bill](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/a1620), which provides a rent supplement of 85% of the difference between the fair market value of a two bedroom apartment ($1,951) in NYC and the current \"shelter supplement\" of $400 per month for a family ($250 for an individual) (a total annual benefit of $15,820 per year for a family in New York City).  The supplement  is less expensive than the annual cost of shelter beds and keeps vulnerable tenants from becoming homeless. New York state must pass this legislation**.**",
            "- **Focus support for survivors of domestic violence.** Domestic violence is one of the main drivers of women and children ending up in shelters. However, only 23% of the domestic violence victims are in specialized DV shelters. The overwhelming majority are in the regular shelter system and are not receiving appropriate services. Andrew Yang will expand the number of domestic violence shelters in the city to meet the needs of survivors, and will focus attention on families with DV experience moving out of shelter and into permanent apartments and into NYCHA.",
            "##### Improve Shelter Conditions",
            "- **Require DHS caseworkers and service providers have the training they need to support people with mental and emotional needs.** All employees at DHS' Prevention Assistance and Temporary Housing (PATH) intake centers, must have trauma-informed training. Likewise, although many service providers train their staff, the funding for such programs come out of their indirect costs. A Yang administration will run programs that bring professional development and staff training to providers so that these costs do not need to come out of nonprofits' bottom lines. Currently, there is[ legislation in the City Council ](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3498478&GUID=C0334F31-8374-4860-AC59-2E00539E60E5&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=customer+service+training)that would require DHS to provide customer service training to improve the standard of care given to vulnerable individuals and families who enter into our shelter system. Andrew Yang will support this legislative effort.\n- **Expand municipal broadband, starting with City shelters.** It has been estimated that there are some 100,000 homeless children in the city that are not receiving appropriate educational instruction. Andrew Yang will make sure that every homeless child has a computer and internet connection,[ read our plan for broadband access](https://www.yangforny.com/policies/broadband-access). ",

            "In spite of their best efforts to make New York City more affordable, the current Administration focused affordable housing production only to meet targeted goals of unit creation. This has resulted in a preference to build at higher Area Median Incomes (AMIs) and studio units, which are not appropriate for meeting the needs of our lowest-income families. A Yang Administration would take a comprehensive approach that focuses real resources on deep affordability, units suitable for families not only singles and couples, and in a diverse array of communities-- wealthy and poor-- to ensure we build to meet the needs of all New Yorkers, rather than build to meet arbitrary unit goals. ",
            "Andrew Yang's affordable housing plan combines both short and long-term solutions to address New York City's need for permanently affordable housing for New Yorkers, particularly those at 0 - 80% AMI. Beyond this, Yang is committing $4 billion to produce 250,000 units of affordable housing over the next eight years across every neighborhood in all five boroughs. ",
            "**1. Invest $4 billion annually on affordable housing.** ",
            "In order to achieve the supply and affordability our city needs, we need a bold commitment to funding this housing production. Andrew Yang commits to spending $4 billion annually, which will allow us to build and preserve 30,000 affordable apartments per year, which would average more than the highest totals during the de Blasio administration. This money will be used in part to convert outdated and unused hotels and office buildings into affordable and supportive housing, described below. ",
            "**2. Launch New Housing New York 25 (\"NHNY25\"), creating at least 25,000 new deeply affordable units, inclusive of supportive housing, using existing hotels that will not reopen:** Hotels can be converted into housing both economically and quickly.  No other vehicle can achieve results fast enough to demonstrate change early within a next administration. New York City has a total of 127,810 hotel rooms with a [pre-pandemic average occupancy rate of 81.7%](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/planning-level/housing-economy/nyc-hotel-market-analysis.pdf) across all five boroughs. The City estimates that New York will not see a recovery in the hotel industry until at least 2025. Many hotels will continue to remain empty or underutilized, making them ripe for immediate redevelopment into permanently affordable housing.  A Yang Administration will provide regulatory relief and forgivable grants to eligible hotel properties entering into agreements with New York City for long term residential uses at affordable rents.  This new effort, New Housing New York, will allow for the conversion of some buildings, mainly hotels, and obsolete office buildings, throughout the City into tens of thousands of new units of housing.  By providing larger forgivable grants to owners or developers who agree to convert buildings into supportive housing and deeply affordable housing targeted toward people in the greatest need, this housing can take advantage of a once in a generation opportunity to create affordable housing for the New Yorkers who need it most. A Yang administration will create a minimum of 5,000 new units of housing in the first 18 months of the Administration, scaling up to 25,000 by 2025. A Yang administration will leverage funding in the Biden [$1.9 trillion stimulus plan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/04/08/homeless-hud-marcia-fudge/), which is dedicated for use in buying and converting hotels and motels.",
            "**3. Ease Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADUs) Restrictions:** An estimated[ 114,000 people](https://therealdeal.com/2020/02/04/citys-basement-apartment-crackdown-ramps-up/) live in basements in New York City - many of these tenants are undocumented, low-income and living in potentially dangerous or unsafe homes. Andrew Yang will support state initiatives to allow for more ADU construction and City code changes to ease the legalization of basement apartments and will pick up where the current Administration left off on the East New York basement legalization pilot program.",
            "**4. Make it Easier For New Yorkers to Find a Rent-Stabilized Apartment:** Rent Stabilization requires landlords to renew leases while capping the allowable increases in rent.  A Yang administration recognizes that access to New York's supply of Rent-Stabilized apartments provides housing stability for millions of New Yorkers, yet this supply is dwindling. The Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 made necessary changes to the rent laws to preserve the approximately 1 million Rent-Stabilized apartments in New York City. Under a Yang administration, the City would go further and connect New Yorker's with Rent-Stabilized apartments in their neighborhoods. ",
            "The Yang administration would leverage the NYCApp to create a StreetEasy/Zillow for Rent-Stabilized units so landlords can list upcoming vacancies in Rent-Stabilized units for free. Prospective tenants can provide their rental criteria (\"2 bedroom in East New York for under $1,500\") and their  qualifications on their \"profile,\" including income, connections to the community, why they would make an ideal long-term tenant, etc.  The NYCApp  would immediately send prospective tenants available vacant Rent-Stabilized apartments that meet their requirements while also sending landlord's a list of eligible tenants.  The NYCApp would facilitate an easy and immediate application process. Users, both landlords and tenants, would be able to access providers of innovative housing products, such as security deposit alternatives and rent guaranty products to ease the application and lower the cost of finding rent stabilized housing.",
            "**5. Provide incentives for landlords to voluntarily put units back into rent regulation:** A Yang administration will prioritize City benefits for landlords who agree to put units back into the Rent Stabilization.  For example, federal HOME Investment Partnership Program funds administered by the New York State Housing Trust Fund Corporation (HTFC) for housing renovation and construction and that is allocated through City agencies will be prioritized for projects in which the landlord agrees to provide a rent-stabilized lease to the next tenant. ",
            "**6. Increase the City's commitment to capital funding for 100% affordable housing developments:** Andrew Yang is in full support of United4Housing's [platform for housing](https://u4housing.thenyhc.org/) and our next Mayor's reinvestment.  A Yang administration will maintain and increase the City's pre-pandemic $5.9 billion capital commitment to affordable housing. The current administration cut $1.2B of that amount, and restored some. All the cuts should be restored and the City's commitment should be increased. A Yang administration also supports programs to increase the capacity of affordable housing developers to develop larger 100% affordable projects. A Yang administration will ensure that the City's capital funding commitment should target and subsidize projects with deep affordability (units for households earning less than 40% AMI).",
            "**7. Embrace comprehensive planning as the framework for land use and zoning in New York City:** New York currently has no long term plan for land use and zoning and as a result, faces a lack of coordination across City agencies and deep inefficiencies in multi-agency policymaking. As a result of a lack of proactive planning with a citywide view, communities are forced into reactionary and defensive positions. The current land use review process fails to address the needs of communities suffering from decades of disinvestment and neglect. At the same time, we lack a coordinated vision to support the equitable growth we need in order to solve our City's housing crisis.  A Yang administration will execute the creation of a Citywide Long Term Plan once every 10 years with substantial community input. ",
            "**8. Eliminate the practice of \"Member Deference\":** Currently, when the city pursues a rezoning of a neighborhood or a major project, not only must the plan survive the legal process known as ULURP, but it also has to be approved by that local Council Member in an informal process known as member deference. This process is reminiscent of the fillibuster many Democrats- Andrew included- have wanted to dismantle in the U.S. Senate. *Actually*, it's even worse in that it's completely based in tradition and doesn't require a vote to be abolished. Massive policy changes are handed over to a single person. It's undemocratic. And it actually puts each City Council member in a very tough spot where they become a lightning rod for any project that is considered in their district. Andrew Yang will work with the Council to move away from member deference. ",
            "**9. Expand support for meaningful community engagement in the land use process:** Andrew Yang's focus will be on speeding up approvals for 100% affordable housing projects through reforming ULURP. The city should have a system where voices of the underserved are given equal weight to the loudest special interests who dominate meetings most New Yorkers don't even know are happening. It's counterproductive to waste months in one hearing after another, waiting for advisory votes, when we often know what the right thing to do is. Community Boards and community based organizations often lack the resources to evaluate or meaningfully participate in land use actions affecting their community, oftentimes until its too late. A Yang administration will **req**uire experts from the Department of City Planning, or city funded non-profit organizations, to assist CBOs in evaluating Environmental Assessment Statements (\"EAS\") for, Determinations of Significance, and the Environmental Impact Statement for land use actions affecting their communities.  A  Yang administration will also allow CBOs and Community Boards to more effectively propose their own ideas for City Owned land.",
            "**10. Use City-owned land to expand affordable housing:** The City has almost 3,000 parcels of land or residential structures listed as having \"no use.\" All no use residential structured should be surveyed and, if suitable, quickly transformed into supportive housing by the City's Department of Design and Construction (DDC). A Yang administration will survey all \"no-use vacant land\" and determine which parcels are suitable for residential structures and then place modular or other prefabricated dwelling units on that land, or enlist a City-contracted non-profit housing organization to do so.   A Yang administration will require City agencies to inventory their City owned parcels currently used for vehicle parking or construction material storage that have residential or commercial zoning.  Those under-utilized parcels should be the site of deeply affordable housing. ",
            "**11. Move away from the de Blasio administration's preference for rezoning Black and Brown neighborhoods toward rezoning transit-rich, higher-income neighborhoods.** Under the de Blasio administration's signature housing policy, Mandatory Inclusionary Housing, rezonings were mostly pursued in low-income communities of color. This not only placed the burden for the housing stock on these communities and perpetuated the risks of gentrification, but the math also did not work out. We need to create density in communities where market rate units can actually subsidize the MIH units in those developments. The city can set an important precedent now by rezoning SoHo. It's significant that not a single unit of affordable housing has been built in SoHo in the past eight years. We can't only focus rezonings in Black and brown neighborhoods or only build affordable housing in certain communities.",
            "**12. Expand Community Land Trusts in partnership with community based organizations across the five boroughs:** A Community Land Trust (CLT) is a nonprofit entity that stewards the housing/buildings on its property by retaining ownership of the land while ensuring the buildings remain affordable.  It's an alternative to profit seeking private ownership that puts the needs of the tenants first. Many organizations and grassroots efforts are interested in CLT expansion, and the city should serve as an eager partner. A Yang administration will create an office within HPD charged with supporting, staffing, maintaining and growing the number of CLTs in New York City, and allocate funding for staff to run CLTs and organize efforts so they are successful. ",
            "**13. Make co-living an official part of NYC's housing stock:** As much as **** 25% of households in NYC are adults living with roommates (\"coliving\"). City codes discourage the use of apartments by groups of roommates by limiting the number of unrelated individuals who can be in a \"family\" to three and requiring those three individuals live in a \"common household.\" These arcane laws were designed to prevent \"blight\" but remain on the books and artificially constrain housing supply and increasing rents. Andrew Yang will amend City codes to increase the number of unrelated individuals who can share dwelling in a multi-family (3 or more units) from 3 to 6 and remove the requirements that they occupy as a \"family.\" This would not make changes to the life and safety codes, for example minimum room sizes, egress and light requirements would all remain the same. More importantly, coliving has the opportunity to free up other housing units that are more suitable for families.By legalizing coliving, a Yang administration will support construction and rehabilitation of sites for artist enclaves, and with unit set asides for freelancers, creatives and performers.",
            "**14. Encourage the development of microunits (aka \"tiny homes\" or Small Efficiency Dwelling Units, also known as \"SEDUs\").** In 2017, the City reduced the minimum square footage of a dwelling to 200 square feet making it possible for the construction of microunits.  However, the Dwelling Unit Factor (the number of dwellings permitted on a lot depending on the allowable FAR) discourage microunits because each micro unit would count as a dwelling. Andrew Yang will reform the Dwelling Unit Factor where a building contains microunits so that smaller units have a lesser impact on the lots Dwelling Unit Factor and encourage the use of modular construction for micro units. ",
            "**15. Remove parking minimums.** We require new buildings to create a [minimum number of parking spaces](https://www.manhattan-institute.org/nyc-zoning-laws-hinder-economic-recovery) and it causes unnecessary red-tape, delays, and increased prices on new housing developments. Buffalo did this well, and New York City should follow their plan. This space in buildings can be used for so many better purposes. Housing chief among them.",

From the Harlem Jazz Renaissance, to rap music in the Bronx, to the days of Studio 54, and more recently, the early 2000's rebirth of Rock and Roll sparked in the Lower East Side and Brooklyn, our arts, culture and entertainment is what makes New York City a place like no other. New York is where performers, artists, musicians, entertainers and culture have thrived. After all, NYC is known as the city that never sleeps, a place welcome to all, where tourists worldwide come to experience a special kind of magic.",
            "Broadway shut down for the first time in our city's history and with it went thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity. According to a recent survey by the[ NYS Department of Labor](https://www.labor.ny.gov/stats/PDFs/Broadway-Theaters-An-Economic-Engine-for-New-York.pdf), the 2018-2019 season on Broadway was the highest grossing and widely attended. Broadway production grossed $1.83 billion in ticket sales, up 7.8% over 2017-2018 levels, total attendance at performances reached 14.8 million, more than the combined attendance of the 10 professional major league sports teams in NYC and New Jersey. Broadway theatres contributed over $12.6 billion on top of ticket sales to the New York City economy and supported more than 12,600 direct jobs and 74,500 indirect jobs. Yet a recent report by the[ New York State Comptroller](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/osdc/arts-entertainment-and-recreation-new-york-city-recent-trends-and-impact-covid-19), Tom DiNapoli revealed that NYC's arts, entertainment and recreation sector plummeted by 66% from December 2019 to December 2020.",
            "With many theatres slated to open in the fall of 2021, there is still much to be done in the immediate months preceding Broadway's reopening. Andrew Yang will be a partner to the arts and culture sector from his first day in office.",

            "**Public safety is key.** ",
            "Andrew Yang has heard the calls from performers and operators that a safe theatre district is a thriving theatre district. Understanding that much of the vibrancy of Midtown will come back once office spaces, theatres and restaurants reopen, Andrew Yang will be a partner in sustaining this vibrancy. That is why a Yang administration will deliver on increasing public safety, reducing quality of life complaints, effectively picking up the garbage, and addressing the street homelessness crisis. We cannot divorce our economic rebound from other social issues, such as housing scarcity, poverty and homelessness. Homelessness was already a pervasive crisis before the pandemic, but the number of homeless persons in Times Square alone increased by 223% between March and September of 2020. ",
            "**Coordinate city services to be tailored to neighborhoods' needs.**",
            "Too often city planning is done with only the daytime in mind. The creation of the Office of Nightlife was intended to reorient the city's focus to consider planning for the nighttime and how to mend relations within communities. Andrew Yang will support community-driven plans to improve quality of life in neighborhoods. Examples of smart city planning that takes into account the needs of the night include reducing congestion and increasing garbage collection in entertainment zones.  This work has already begun with the city's [Lower East Side Quality of Life Improvement Plan](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/mome/nightlife/les-improvement-plan.page#:~:text=The%20Lower%20East%20Side%20Quality,on%20Manhattan's%20Lower%20East%20Side.).",

More room at concession stands will not only improve safety of those who would otherwise be waiting on long-crowded lines in doors, but will also incentivize higher purchases of concession products with shorter wait times, thereby helping theatres generate additional revenue. A Yang administration will seek to work with the industry, labor unions and local stakeholders in the Times Square area to continue the Open Streets program on Broadway and in other commercial corridors, particularly in the warmer months.",
            "**Get the economy running faster with consolidation of vaccine verification tools.** ",
            "In order to reopen our civic and cultural life, our city will need to implement protocols that give individuals -- tourists, theatregoers, actors, staff -- confidence that they can return to establishments safely.  To that end, a Yang administration will **facilitate the use of \"vaccine passports,\"** which will provide people with ways to prove their vaccination or COVID-19 test results in a privacy-protecting, verifiable, and voluntary manner. A Yang administration would also work with technology companies to ensure that individuals have complete control over their own data (when it is shared, and with whom), that data security is tantamount, and that vaccine passports work even for those without a smartphone. ",
            "Other countries, such as Denmark and the United Kingdom, have announced plans for similar vaccine passports and the Biden administration has already [begun working with private companies to develop standards](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/28/vaccine-passports-for-work/?campaign_id=4&emc=edit_dk_20210329&instance_id=28599&nl=dealbook&regi_id=85566039&segment_id=54405&te=1&user_id=6addc2a6428a0f3ec21b2dde2023431d) for handling credentials.

Likewise, many private companies such as Ticketmaster have already been experimenting with this technology and expect it to be used widely in the immediate months, but much more will need to continue to be done to streamline and consolidate these services, with particular emphasis on privacy rights. A Yang administration will partner with the Biden administration and work with other global cities to develop best-practices for privacy, inclusivity, and technical interoperability. Tech companies, airlines and other private companies are already jumping on this technology. Therefore we need a measured city-wide approach to make sure that data is not centralized, there are standards for interoperability between technology solutions, and all equity and privacy concerns are addressed. Furthermore, pre-pandemic theatres were already using technology such as[ GalaPro](https://www.galapro.com/) that operates through a smartphone app to provide audio transcription services for the hearing impaired so there is some precedent to use technology in the service of making Broadway more accessible and safe. ",
            "**Work in partnership with the private sector to buy blocks of theatre tickets: \"Always New York\" campaign.**",
            "In the months after 9/11 when Broadway shows were shut down for a few days and tourism dropped, the [city bought 50,000 tickets](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/22/theater/how-broadway-bounced-back-after-9-11-but-downtown-theater-lacked-the-right-ties.html) at $50 each. 35,000 of said tickets were given to NYC & Company, the city's tourism bureau, for a \"Spend Your Regards to Broadway\" campaign. The promotion gave two tickets to a Broadway show to anyone who spent $500 at city stores or bought other theatre tickets.\" The majority of the tickets went to people who turned in receipts showing that they spent money in the local economy, to school districts for school trips and the remaining 15,000 tickets went to the Twin Towers Fund for firefighters, police officers, rescue workers and victims' families.\" ",
            "With shows having been shuttered for over a year, by the time they reopen, the rebuilding process will be longer and more strenuous. That is why a Yang administration will seek to adapt this program for the 21st century. The administration will negotiate with shows to purchase blocks of hundreds of thousands of tickets at reduced prices to Broadway theatres, off Broadway and other cultural venues. It will commit to buying a portion of tickets with funding from the Mayor's Fund and will seek commitments from the private sector to match these purchases (e.g., J.P. Morgan, Deloitte, PwC & EY etc). The companies could keep some portion of the tickets for themselves, while donating the majority of the other tickets to non-profit organizations around the city, starting with those that support essential workers and first responders. This plan would identify businesses within the theatre district across several categories (e.g. restaurants, local attractions) and register them for the campaign. ",
            "**Example of the possible Tiers:**",
            "Tier 1 = Premium Front Orchestra Seating for spending with local restaurants/businesses $1500 or more",

            "Tier 5 = \"The Lottery\" for spending with local restaurants/businesses $100 or more the participants would be placed into a lottery that would randomly sample",
            "This program would simultaneously be an effort to bring people back into theatre seats while also stimulating economic growth and activity for NYC businesses. Based on the success of this effort, a Yang administration would extend this program to include Off-Broadway. We would also seek to make this effort a permanent mechanism to drive the sustainability of Broadway/Off-Broadway activity by linking it to the city's existing [Broadway Week ](https://www.nytix.com/articles/broadway-week)to increase the number of shows and tickets available. We will also seek to expand discounted ticket programs to help provide ongoing opportunities, for those who traditionally do not have access, to experience the magic of the theatre.",
            "**Encourage theatre's to offer Personal Seat Licenses.**",
            "A personal seat license (PSL) is a paid license that entitles the holder to the right to buy season tickets for a certain seat. This practice is often used in sports arenas. Andrew Yang will work with theatre owners to apply this concept to live performance. Doing so would encourage reliable ticket sales and a portion of the proceeds could go toward charity and revitalizing NYC.",
            "### II) Bringing Back Tourists",
            "New York City[ drew a record](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/nyregion/nyc-tourism-covid.html) 66 million tourists in 2019 and was on pace for even more in 2020. And before the shutdown in March, the hospitality industry provided as many as 400,000 jobs and drew $46 billion in annual spending. Thousands of our restaurants, bars, theatres and hotels rely on these visitors. A Yang administration will commit to returning these travelers and sustaining our vital industries. ",
            "**Partner with the industry to mount Always New York, the largest marketing campaign in Broadway's history.** Broadway will come back, but to get ticket sales to pre-pandemic levels it will require sustained outreach to New York City residents, as well as regional, national and  international tourists. The Mayor's office must play a leading role in bringing back these tourists with a NYC focused, Broadway centric marketing campaign. As described above, the Yang administration will purchase block tickets in partnership with private sector partners that will incentivize people to spend money in NYC in exchange for receiving the tickets. ",
            "Beyond this,[ Nycgo](http://nycgo.com) provides a wealth of information on major attractions, restaurants, transportation and more, for locals and tourists alike. A Yang administration will commit to prioritizing these efforts to support culture in NYC, including using city assets to promote these resources and in the 311 App and MTA apps, where many tourists go to learn how to navigate our city. We will work with companies such as Google and Facebook to dedicate free ad space to assist in getting out the word. ",
            "And in a direct outreach effort domestically and abroad, we will facilitate projects with[ NYC & Company](https://www.nycgo.com/), which participates in roadshows and sales missions abroad with Broadway stars. In 2019,[ NYC & Company received](https://adobeindd.com/view/publications/a614092f-2162-4a39-97c3-f4d67b0cbe0b/uiji/publication-web-resources/pdf/NYC_&_Company_Annual_Report_2019-2020.pdf) $20.9 million in NYC contract funds, which were used toward campaigns reaching 21 countries with 20 international partners. A Yang administration would dramatically increase this allocation to $100+ million for Yang's first two years in office to ensure tourists choose NYC --and not other travel destinations-- to visit once the pandemic is over. NYC & Company membership includes theatre, restaurants and nightlife establishments, hotels, sports facilities and more - Broadway is one of New York's best marketers. For example, in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks, the theatre community \"gathered costume actors from every Broadway show in Times Square on September 28 to sing \"New York, New York\" for[ a commercial that ran in 20 countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/22/theater/how-broadway-bounced-back-after-9-11-but-downtown-theater-lacked-the-right-ties.html).\" This new marketing campaign for the 2021 return of Broadway will reach tourists domestically, regionally and all over the world. A Yang administration will also establish a taskforce of performers, workers, and industry stakeholders to design and implement the marketing campaign.",

            "In 2020, Netflix revenue was estimated at $25 billion in a category that's roughly 3 times bigger than that. With the world home-bound in quarantine, Netflix[ posted positive cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/how-netflix-makes-money/) for the first time since 2011, profiting greatly off of every day consumers. These massive companies have cornered the market in at-home streaming and most content generation is being lost to these monopolies. **A Yang administration will establish a pilot program to support high-quality streaming of theatre productions**, particularly, but not limited to, those on Broadway. While seeing a recorded performance on a screen cannot be compared with an in person performance, streaming would offer a new line of revenue that would safeguard against any future downturns, crises or revenue losses that live performances might face. Hamilton, a once-in-a-generation show, was successful in producing a film with Disney+ in which[ a staggering 37.1% of subscribers](https://variety.com/vip/disney-hamilton-audience-nearly-3x-bigger-than-any-netflix-program-in-july-1234729439/) (22 million) watched the film over its first month, which was three times the number that watched the second widest-reaching title of that month, Netflix's true-crime docuseries. Another example of this model is[ BroadwayHD](https://www.broadwayhd.com/), which would provide a good framework for the new platform",
            "The magic of sitting in a theatre and experiencing a live performance is unparalleled and can never be replicated, but we can experiment with how to bring these spectacular performances to more viewers while opening up new revenue streams for productions to survive in the long run. ",
            "In the last decade we've seen a huge growth of film and tv shot on location in NYC, Andrew will continue to encourage this trend. A Yang administration will work with industry leaders to expand this concept as a way to generate revenue and jobs for current productions, in the immediate reopening of Broadway while performance uptick will still be low, but demand for viewing the return of performances -- even at home -- will be high. This will be a direct job creator and source of income for performers in the films through ongoing residuals and royalties that could provide artists with a steady income between jobs and help them clear their health insurance threshold. We've also seen an increase in Broadway productions being turned into feature films, like Lin Manuel Miranda's In the Heights, which was shot on location in NYC, and hits theatres this June. A Yang administration will work with the industry to overcome any contractual challenges in making these projects happen and serve as a convenor for those who would like to explore this entirely voluntary option.",
            "**Stimulate tourism by extending a 3 month tax holiday to NYC hotels.**",
            "In [2019](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aNHB5-sLkfeJbT5MdMV-pq7ymxkElXSx/edit#gid=1866603365), hotels generated ~$10.5bn revenue for the New York City economy and ~$1.5bn in tax revenue. New York State collects 4% tax and NYC collects an additional 10% on hotel rooms through sales and occupancy taxes, generating about $1 billion in city revenue pre-pandemic. New York City hotel revenue is down roughly [80%](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/planning-level/housing-economy/nyc-hotel-market-analysis.pdf). For the first three months of his administration, Andrew Yang will reduce the tax from 10% to 5% to give hotels a boost, foregoing an estimated $50-75 million in tax revenue. The savings hotels will incur from expected tax bill reductions could be passed onto consumers by expected reductions in cost of hotel rooms. This will generate additional incentives for tourists to come back to the city that hotels, theatre and other destinations can use in marketing, sending the message that NYC is an affordable, safe and attractive destination to visit for tourists' first trip post-pandemic.",

            "**Equity must be at the center of our arts revival.** ",
            "Any \"Broadway recovery\" must be focused on its workers, not just its producers and venue operators.

            "**Make NYC Affordable.** ",
            "Andrew Yang is committed to creating an affordable, welcoming city with opportunity for all. A Yang administration will create 25,000 units of affordable housing by 2025 through converting underutilized hotel rooms, will protect tenants through expanding the right to counsel and ramp up enforcement efforts on landlords who illegally take units out of rent stabilization and invest in comprehensive community-led development.

            "**Support the diversity and inclusion efforts of those in the arts who are doing this work.**",
            "Groups in the arts, including unions and non profits have led the conversation in working to make Broadway more inclusive and equitable. Andrew Yang will partner with these groups to fill in any needs they have. For example, the city would offer racial bias and sexual harassment training to support the work theatrical unions are doing in this space and expand the reach of the union. The theatre community has been organically leading in this regard, such as through advocacy by the Black Theatre Coalition and a commitment by \"Company\" that when Broadway resumes, the musical \"[will hire 10 young black men and women](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/this-actor-and-choreographer-are-on-a-mission-more-black-people-running-broadway/2020/07/23/258318b2-cc4c-11ea-bc6a-6841b28d9093_story.html) for paid internships in every department of the 80-person production.\" Andrew Yang will also support efforts to create a pipeline to job opportunities for women and people of color in industry leadership positions, such as producers, general managers, and artistic directors so as to better reflect the demographics of the city. And through spending some city resources on buying block tickets, which will be matched by the private sector, a Yang administration is committed to diversifying audiences and increasing access to those who typically do not partake in the magic of theatre, as well.",
            "**Advocate for Save our Stages, Take Two: relief for workers.**",
            "The Save our Stages Act, passed in Congress in December 2020 as part of the $900 billion COVID-19 stimulus package was a hard-fought and groundbreaking effort. The Act allocated $15 billion in Small Business Administration (SBA) grants to live venue operators, museum operators, motion picture theatre operators and talent representatives to cover expenses such as payroll costs, rent, mortgage payments and utilities. While this grant program is a major victory and will undoubtedly help venues stay in business so that after the pandemic, artists can return to places of work, it falls short of trickling down to the performers, designers, stagehands and others who had no recourse during the pandemic. That is why a Yang administration will advocate for a \"**Save our Stages, Take Two,\"** in which grant money will be allocated to the workers, including costume designers who were left out of Shuttered Venue Operator (SVO) grants, not just the venues. Workers in the arts have been struggling to survive through the pandemic and federal efforts to add onto Save our Stages must be worker-focused. Other cities have used federal funds through the CARES Act, for example, to support both venues and workers.[ Tulsa Oklahoma](https://www.tulsapeople.com/the-voice/tulsa-fmac-announces-music-recovery-program/article_c6a0aa92-028f-11eb-960b-33dffbc893b1.html) set up a grant program for venues that requires 50% of the funds go toward musicians and performers. Any new round of funding, whether through a new iteration of Save our Stages or the American Rescue Plan must make funds available to workers in the industry in addition to venue owners/ operators and the city should be committed to providing resources to support businesses who apply for these federal grants, including in multiple languages. ",
            "**Create a universal portable benefits fund.** ",
            "Administered by the NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protections, the New Benefits Fund will support expanded worker protections and create a larger pool of workers to negotiate lower premiums for benefits that would support a growing class of independent workers. The fund will be applicable to employees, freelancers and independent contractors who are not covered by their employers. Actors, performers, and other industry workers, for example, could pull from the fund when they are in between shows or if they do not qualify for union coverage. The New Benefits Fund will acknowledge the reality that work has changed for thousands of New Yorkers and support the creation of flexible jobs by ensuring every worker in NYC has access to the protections they need to survive, especially in a post-pandemic city. Modeled after [Philadelphia's Domestic Worker Bill of Rights](https://www.phila.gov/documents/domestic-workers-bill-of-rights-resources/) and [New York State's Black Car Fund](https://www.nybcf.org/about), the New Benefits Fund will pool resources to aggregate benefits, such as: paid time off, workers compensation, healthcare subsidies, and more.

            "**Support calls to restore funding for healthcare.**",
            "Healthcare is another major concern. Due to the pandemic, union health funds are nearing their last dollar. For example, the Actors' Equity Fund, which receives 88% of its funding from employer contributions is projected to deplete [ reserve levels down to $30 million](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-citys-creative-class-faces-health-care-crunch-11611669604), compared with $120 million before the pandemic hit, leaving thousands of actors, musicians and other creative professionals vulnerable to losing their healthcare coverage, if they haven't already. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we must ensure all workers-- no matter their income, or work status-- have adequate access to healthcare coverage. For those who are lucky enough to be union workers, performing at union houses, they are eligible for health insurance. But even those lucky actors, often experience dry spells, in which they are out of work for some time and do not meet the 12-16 week eligibility threshold, and therefore lose healthcare coverage. While the federal Affordable Care Act provides some safety net, these plans can often be expensive, costing in some instances,[ over $400 a month](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/much-health-insurance-cost-without-subsidy) in out of pocket expenses, which can be cost-prohibitive for struggling artists. Likewise, while the investments in COBRA in the federal relief package are helpful, Andrew Yang stands with labor unions in the industry who have[ called to restore funding](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/help-workers-maintain-their-health-coverage/?link_id=5&can_id=360e100f9233de779b9c3464445729d1&source=email-protect-ny-cobra-subsidies&email_referrer=email_1089266&email_subject=protect-ny-cobra-subsidies) in the state's budget this year to a program that grants assistance equal to 50% of applicants' COBRA or continuation health benefits and premiums.

Among the many resources our public school students were deprived of throughout the pandemic, arts education was among the greatest losses. In the last school year, the Department of Education's arts[ budget was $21.5 million](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/nycs-4500-teaching-artists-have-been-hit-hard-pandemic-cuts) and the DOE partnered with cultural organizations to bring 4,500 artists into classrooms across the city. But because of the pandemic, the city was forced to cut the DOE budget arts budget[ by 70 percent](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/nyc-slashes-art-education-budget-1891325) and students got almost no arts education during remote learning. Yet, long before COVID-19 our students, particularly those in low-income communities received inadequate arts education. **A Yang administration will restore the funding that was cut in the budget for arts education and expand partnerships with the arts community and philanthropic organizations to bring more opportunities to our students**. Arts education in schools will contribute to a holistic and well-rounded education for our students, supporting their mental and emotional health, and inspiring them to enter both creative and non-creative jobs. Andrew Yang worries deeply about artificial intelligence and automation displacing American jobs, but by giving students a glimpse into thoroughly human jobs that emphasize passion, thinking, empathy and inspiration, we will be contributing to a job force that cannot be automated away. ",
            "**A Yang administration will fight in Washington for financial fairness for the performing arts community.** Professional actors and stage managers often spent up to 20-30% of their income on necessary expenses. Claiming the deductions they're entitled to for these business costs was already an unwelcome administrative burden for many New Yorkers. Unfortunately, President Trump's 2017 tax reform law[ eliminated tax write offs](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2019-10-23/actors-owe-thousands-of-dollars-after-trumps-tax-reforms) for work-related expenses many actors use, such as headshots and agent and manager commissions. Losing this write-off cost many performers thousands of dollars over the last two years, at a time when other costs -- such as housing -- were rising as well. As a country, we cannot risk losing talented young performers because the career's financial burdens are too great; as a city, New York will suffer disproportionately if aspiring artists are forced away from their dreams. Andrew Yang is uniquely positioned to work with leaders in Washington to fix this problem. As a prominent Democratic voice who helped secure both Georgia senate seats, and with  the Democratic majority, Yang will leverage his relationships to not only **restore miscellaneous itemized deductions on federal taxes,** but to advocate for better tax treatment for artists at the federal level.",

            "New York City has been a leader on sexual and reproductive health, rights and justice. Thanks to a network of providers across the City who deliver culturally competent care, to funding abortion care outright, to expanding trans healthcare - including Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming healthcare, to finally codifying our State's abortion law to be in line with Roe v. Wade at the federal level, New Yorkers rely on the healthcare infrastructure of our City to receive comprehensive, non-judgmental sexual and reproductive healthcare that meets their needs. ",
            "It goes without saying - reproductive freedom will never be realized until all people have the true economic opportunity to make healthcare decisions that are best for them and their families. Well before COVID-19 hit, race-based health disparities in New York City were stark. Black women in New York [are eight times more likely to die of pregnancy-related complications](https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/365-18/de-blasio-administration-launches-comprehensive-plan-reduce-maternal-deaths-life-threatening) than white women, much higher than the national average. Comprehensive sex education, while recommended by the New York City Department of Education, [is not widespread](https://www.nyclu.org/en/issues/education-policy-center/comprehensive-sex-education).

A Yang administration will ensure that while we build a better healthcare infrastructure, we also invest in solutions to end disparities in healthcare outside of the healthcare system itself. Ensuring all New Yorkers have safe housing, access to transit, healthy food in their neighborhoods, and are empowered with information to make decisions that are best for them and their families, are key to reducing inequities, and securing true access to sexual and reproductive healthcare. ",
            "When it comes to sexual health and reproductive justice, a Yang administration will champion the following measures: ",
            "**Expand the Reach of Reproductive Health Providers, Especially Safety Net Providers**",
            "Now more than ever, safety net providers like Callen Lorde Community Health Clinic and Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, and that provide trusted services to New Yorkers in need could not be more essential as part of our City's healthcare continuum. We will expand support for all safety net providers that specialize in healthcare services for LGBTQ+ folks, immigrant communities, young people, people seeking reproductive healthcare and providers trusted by immigrant communities, and ensure that deceptive establishments that prey on women of color like \"Crisis Pregnancy Centers\" are out of business once for all. ",
            "**Expand Oversight & Enforcement of \"Crisis Pregnancy Centers\"**",
            "Crisis pregnancy centers or pregnancy service centers (PSCs) operate through deceptive services. Often these establishments, which do not have accredited medical providers on site, locate themselves very near to clinics in low-income communities and lure patients in through [false advertising and predatory practices](https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/09/13/562988/). Nearly all PSCs offer free pregnancy testing (most are over-the-counter & self-administered tests) and several offer ultrasounds to clients. Providing these tests and ultrasounds helps foster an impression among women who visit these centers that PSCs are medical facilities.  PSCs, however, may not make clear to their clients that they are not actually licensed medical facilities. Other deceptive tactics include: arranging an appointment for an \"abortion\" and repeatedly postponing the date until it is too late for the woman to have the abortion; misdiagnosing ultrasounds and providing false information on the woman's medical condition; false information about abortions, including that an abortion will cause the woman to \"bleed out and fall into a coma\" and subjecting women to violent images. In 2011, the Council[ enacted legislation](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=777861&GUID=F7F0B7D7-2FE7-456D-A7A7-1633C9880D92) to ensure PSCs make certain disclosures to clients both orally and in writing, including: a notice of whether the PSC has a licensed medical provider on staff and a notice that NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) encourages women who are or may be pregnant to consult with a licensed medical professional. But, more can be done. A Yang administration would instruct the Department of Consumer Affairs and Worker Protection (DCWP) to conduct more thorough investigations of known PSCs and increase fines for violating the disclosure laws. And DCWP will conduct public education about crisis pregnancy centers: naming them and providing tools to ensure patients are actually receiving the medical care they seek.",
            "**Fund Abortion Care Outright**",
            "Thanks to the advocacy of reproductive health providers and patients, New York City is the first municipality to [fund abortion services outright](https://www.nirhealth.org/fund-abortion-nyc/), setting an example for cities across the country who are fighting back against the rollback of abortion services. A Yang administration will baseline and expand this funding to ensure that reproductive health providers and safety net providers in particular, can continue to serve all New Yorkers. ",
            "**Fight to Repeal the Hyde Amendment Once and for All**",
            "The Hyde Amendment bans the use of federal Medicaid dollars to pay for abortions, leaving states with the responsibility to opt in to covering the cost. The Hyde Amendment is an explicit attack on poor people, people of color, young people and immigrants -- who all disproportionately rely on Medicaid for their health care coverage. While New York State covers the cost of abortion care for people on Medicaid, many states do not, therefore leaving it to patients to pay out of pocket, or carry a pregnancy to term. Andrew Yang will fight with allies in the reproductive health, rights and justice movement to repeal the Hyde Amendment once and for all. ",
            "**Expand Abortion Training for Healthcare Professionals at H+H**",
            "New York state trains one in every seven physicians nationwide and New York City is home to the country's largest public system in the country. Since 2002, Health and Hospitals (H+H) has trained OB-GYNs completing their training in the system on abortion care,[ a recommended practice for all teaching hospitals](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2014/11/abortion-training-and-education) according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). A Yang administration will expand abortion training for healthcare professionals at H+H, ensuring that even more healthcare professionals can serve New Yorkers seeking abortion care.",
            "**Require Comprehensive, Medically Accurate, Age Appropriate, LGTBQ+ Affirming Sexual Health Education, Every Grade, Every Year**",
            "Sex education is only taught for one semester in junior high school and one semester in high school. In 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio established the Sexual Health Education Task Force, which later [recommended](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/genderequity/downloads/pdf/Sex-Ed-Task-Force-Report-2018.pdf) that the New York City Department of Education \"prioritize a culture of sexual wellness and inclusivity in all NYC schools, implement additional professional development opportunities for health education instructors, improve the content, substance, and methods of sexual health education, and strengthen accountability and reporting of sexual health education implementation.\" These recommendations have yet to be implemented. A Yang administration will fully adopt the recommendations of the Sexual Health Education Task Force, and require full implementation of comprehensive, medically accurate, age appropriate, LGBTQ+ affirming sexual and reproductive health education, every grade, every year. A Yang administration will also ensure that the [state-mandated HIV/AIDS curriculum](http://www.p12.nysed.gov/sss/documents/hiv-aids-guidance.pdf), and full implementation of the [newly-passed Erin's Law](http://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/erins-law), to prevent, educate and encourage reporting on child sexual abuse. ",
            "**Strengthen and Enforce New York City's Clinic Access Law**",
            "Violence, coercion and protest activity outside of New York City's reproductive health and abortion clinics [have increased](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/nyregion/new-yorks-abortion-protest-law-is-praised-by-justices-but-few-others.html) in the last decade, prompting the passage of the New York City Clinic Access Act, creating a 15 foot \"buffer zone\" around of healthcare providers' doors, and codifying the protections of the state and federal Federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. Healthcare providers continue to bear the brunt of little enforcement of this law, with protesters oftentimes harassing and targeting patients, or people who they perceive to be patients, outside of clinics. A Yang administration will work with reproductive health and abortion clinics to fully enforce New York City's clinic access law, ensuring that all people seeking sexual and reproductive health services can do so safely and without intimidation. ",
            "**Amend the New York City Charter to Make Ending Racial Health Disparities the Mandate of DOHMH**",
            "A Yang administration will amend the New York City Charter to ensure that ending racial health disparities is among the primary mandates of DOHMH. The leaders that Yang appoints to DOHMH and other relevant city agencies will represent the diversity of New York City and make ending racial health disparities a top priority. ",
            "**Require Racial Equity Competency for All Healthcare Providers in New York City**",
            "Building on the tremendous work of the [Center for Health Equity](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/race-to-justice.page) under former New York City DOHMH Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett, a Yang administration will require racial equity competency as part of teaching and learning at all H+H hospitals, available to providers citywide in partnership with DOHMH, and a requirement for nonprofit organizations seeking City funding to deliver healthcare services.",
            "**Build a Diverse, Culturally Competent Public Health Workforce**",

A Yang administration will **** create a pipeline program for prospective healthcare providers of color to serve communities of color across the five boroughs. With the City University of New York (CUNY) and Health and Hospitals (H+H), we will expand fast-track pipelines into healthcare careers for New York City high school graduates, particularly those of color, who are eager to serve diverse communities in New York City, if they commit to serve New Yorkers upon graduation.

While we have made significant strides in developing treatment paradigms and deploying population level vaccination campaigns to combat COVID-19, there are lasting effects on our people and our healthcare ecosystem. A small number of individuals suffering from Covid-19, sometimes referred to as \"long-haulers,\" will experience symptoms lasting far longer than the typical 2-week duration for mild illness. [Roughly 10%](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3026) of Covid-19 patients experience significant symptoms lasting longer than 3 weeks--months in rare cases--presenting a serious challenge for healthcare providers and policymakers. Although the NIH recently launched a new initiative to better understand these post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), there are few comprehensive studies of persistent Covid-19 symptoms in the medical literature. Most current scholarship includes: practice guidelines/[recommendations](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3026) based on current understanding, [perspective](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771111) and [viewpoint](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771581) articles summarizing current understanding, research [letters](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768351) and studies with small sample sizes. ",
            "As a COVID-19 survivor himself, Andrew Yang will listen to the experts, doctors and scientists as medical knowledge evolves on the complex consequences of COVID-19. The city recently announced an [Aftercare program](https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/254-21/recovery-all-mayor-de-blasio-nyc-test-trace-corps-launch-aftercare-support-new-yorkers), using NYC Test & Trace Corps to engage people who had or were suspected of having COVID-19, but more can be done. To support these individuals, a Yang administration will target three key issues: better understanding the epidemiology, improving treatment, and ensuring insurance coverage. The Yang administration will also spur COVID-19 targeted clinical, biomedical, and public health research, and expand COVID-related social support services.",
            "### I) Improve policy recommendations through classifying and identifying \"long haulers\" ",
            "**Classify long-haulers.** ",
            "There is no uniform diagnostic criteria for \"persistent COVID-19\" and one will be needed to accurately screen and identify these individuals.  Defining persistent COVID-19 is also important for targeting related employment discrimination and protecting the rights of disabled individuals. Andrew Yang will work with labor groups, individuals suffering from persistent COVID-19, medical professionals, long-trusted public health institutions and other stakeholders to ensure that our city is appropriately classifying the syndrome amongst variable groups and presentations of symptoms. We will advocate at the state and federal level to ensure these individuals are covered by employment and disability protections.",
            "**Identify long-haulers by setting up a COVID-19 registry.** ",
            "Andrew Yang will encourage screening for persistent COVID-19 symptoms as part of the application process for city social services, and at medical visits where appropriate for anyone who tested positive for COVID-19. We will support efforts to educate primary care providers about the phenomenon, educate the public and connect them with city resources, and explore the use of screening apps. We will also encourage local health departments to contact COVID-19 survivors at intervals after recovery.",
            "And there is precedent here for establishing a registry. [The World Trade Center Health Registry](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/911health/about/wtc-health-registry.page), is now the largest registry in U.S. history to track the health effects of a disaster. Enrollment in the Registry was voluntary for people who lived, worked or went to school in the area of the WTC disaster, or were involved in rescue and recovery efforts. A Yang administration will use best-practices from the WTC registry to model the COVID-19 registry. This would help healthcare professionals catalogue symptoms, procedures and outcomes related to COVID to be used for enhancing clinical care and made available to support clinical research and recovery. Patient privacy and data security is paramount. Only healthcare professionals will have access to the registry and adequate safety measures will be put in place to ensure the protection and integrity of the information. Further, a Yang administration would create a health registry of medical professionals capable of addressing COVID-19 long haulers to address the supply side of the equation and ensure adequate medical professional capacity when needed.",
            "**Study PASC (aka \"long-hauler\") epidemiology through grant funding for studies.** ",
            "Reported prevalence data is quite variable and many individuals with long-haul COVID-19 symptoms have never received a positive antibody, PCR or rapid test. Andrew Yang will create a grant program to encourage large, well-controlled epidemiologic studies, in partnership with state and local health departments, NYC academic medical centers and community-based organizations to define cross-sectional prevalence estimates. This research will also shed light on the best way to \"live with COVID\" in future years. There are still many unknowns about COVID-19. For example, will it become seasonal like the flu? Will we need vaccine boosters to combat variants? How many boosters would we need, and when would we need them? When are economic shut-downs absolutely necessary for public health and what should they look like?) Investing in scientific research coupled with the NYC registry will put NYC on the cutting edge of data collection and dissemination to inform future response and mitigation efforts.",
            "### II) Improve treatment of long-haulers ",
            "**Study long-hauler clinical course, prognosis, and treatment.** ",
            "Andrew Yang's administration will encourage studies at both public and private hospitals via a targeted grant program discussed above, and will seek federal funds to support such studies, collaborating with national and international bodies to define consensus. This must also include constant educational efforts for patients and providers. ",
            "**Mobilize treatment to marginalized communities.** ",
            "Treatment of persistent COVID-19 symptoms often requires frequent interaction with health care professionals. This may be challenging for individuals who can't take time off of work or who don't live close to their providers. Symptoms may also involve psychiatric symptoms that make it challenging to travel or hard to seek treatment because of stigma. Specialists like neurologists may also be concentrated in inconvenient locations. Andrew Yang will fund the creation of dedicated post-COVID-19 [treatment centers](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/providers/we-know-this-real-new-clinics-aid-virus-long-haulers) with [co-located specialists](https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/88546) in communities of need, some of which are already popping up at hospital systems, currently through three [COVID-19 Centers of Excellenc](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/covid-19-center-of-excellence/)e. Expanding on these sites, a Yang administration will coordinate efforts across the city as part of a larger practice of care. We will also advocate for the loosening of telemedicine laws to improve access to remote care, in particular psychiatric services.",

Currently uninsured patients and those with high-deductible or catastrophic plans will face high out of pocket costs.  Long-haulers may also lose employment-based insurance as a result of their illness.  To ease the financial burden on these patients, a Yang administration will:",
            "- Offer free assistance enrolling those suffering from persistent COVID-19 in insurance and finding appropriate plans via a Helpline.\n- Provide financial support in the form of deductible and co-payment assistance.\n- Vigorously enforce pre-existing conditions protections.\n- Create a COVID-19 relief fund to facilitate financial support, which might also create incentives and financial relief in the event that a booster vaccine might be required each year forthcoming.",

And we will explore the use of home visits and mobile clinics.\n- Facilitate the creation of an online social community that long haulers could use for sharing their stories and connecting with others who may be suffering through similar circumstances.\n- A Yang administration will advocate with private employers and at the state and federal levels for increased paid sick leave requirements, additional employment protections and/or disability insurance, and incentivized work-from-home arrangements.\n- We will launch efforts to specifically educate the public about disability discrimination and workplace rights related to COVID-19.",

The idea would build on past proposals to make Open Streets [permanent](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/04/04/yang-calls-for-permanent-open-streets-program-with-city-funding/) and expand protected bike lanes.",

            "Andrew Yang recognizes that access to healthy, culturally appropriate food is a fundamental human right for every New Yorker. Despite its importance, food equity remains a serious issue in New York City, and disparities in access to nutritious food have only worsened throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. ",
            "Prior to the pandemic, roughly 15% of NYC residents were [food insecure](https://map.feedingamerica.org/county/2018/overall/new-york/county/new-york)-including 12.2% in New York County and 17.5% in Bronx County-meaning they had limited or uncertain access to adequate food. During the pandemic, this number [rose](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-update.html) to nearly 25%. SNAP enrollment in New York City in April of 2020 [increased](https://nyshealthfoundation.org/2020/09/17/nyshealth-testimony-on-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-food-insecurity-in-new-york-state/) by the largest one-month jump ever-nearly 69,000 people. ",
            "The burden of food insecurity does not fall equally across New Yorkers. [Studies](https://nyshealthfoundation.org/2020/09/17/nyshealth-testimony-on-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-food-insecurity-in-new-york-state/) by NYSHealth suggest that a larger proportion of households with children experienced food scarcity and that there are significant disparities across racial and ethnic groups. Rates of food scarcity were three to four times [higher](https://nyshealthfoundation.org/2020/09/17/nyshealth-testimony-on-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-food-insecurity-in-new-york-state/) for Hispanic and Black New Yorkers than among white New Yorkers. Mass job losses throughout the pandemic-many of which occurred in low-wage markets-further [contributed](https://nyshealthfoundation.org/2020/09/17/nyshealth-testimony-on-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-food-insecurity-in-new-york-state/) to food scarcity, with rates three times higher for those who reported lost employment income.",
            "New York City agencies are major providers of meals to residents and city-level reform is crucial for protecting the right to nutritious food. Ten city agencies currently procure and [provide](https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ny2020-finalv2.pdf) over 230 million meals per year. The vast majority are provided by the Department of Education, meaning that vulnerable school children are the largest beneficiaries of City spending. Others impacted by City meal provision include senior citizens, homeless individuals, hospital patients, CUNY students and incarcerated individuals.",
            "And, this is extremely important in the context of coming out from the COVID-19 pandemic, where people with diabetes and other pre-existing conditions, as well as, low-income families were much more likely to get the disease and have worse symptoms. Studies suggest that individuals with diabetes have over a three times [higher likelihood](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33268335/) of being hospitalized with COVID-19.",
            "If we're going to be serious about combating inequality, food access and nutrition must be at the forefront of the next administration's priorities. That means investing in all of the programs that exist but have been half-baked by the current administration. A comprehensive, community-focused reform program is necessary to ensure food equity and build a more sustainable food infrastructure in New York City. Andrew Yang will lead this effort with a bold strategy informed by conversations with local food equity advocates and community leaders.",
            "### As Mayor, Andrew Yang will:",
            "- **Strengthen and expand the Mayor's Office of Food Policy.**\n- **Improve the quality, nutrition, and cultural-appropriateness of City-provided meals.**\n- **Aggressively target structural racism in our food system.**\n- **Make it easier for New Yorkers to participate in SNAP and WIC.**\n- **Ensure the equitable treatment of food workers.**\n- **Build sustainable local food capacity.**",
            "Andrew Yang is committed to ensuring that each and every New Yorker has access to affordable, nutritious, and locally-sourced food. Here's our plan to make New York City the sustainable food capital of our country.",
            "### I) Strengthen and expand the Mayor's Office of Food Policy",
            "**Coordinate efforts.**",
            "A permanent, overarching infrastructure must be created to coordinate the ten city agencies providing food to New Yorkers. Centralizing authority in the Mayor's Office will make it easier to leverage collective purchasing power to lower costs and to standardize nutrition and quality across programs. The inter-agency coordinating power exercised by the \"Food Czar\" in response to the Covid-19 pandemic was [effective and popular](https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ny2020-finalv2.pdf), and we will create a similar, permanent position within the Mayor's Office of Food Policy with a particular focus on food equity.",
            "**Convene a food policy council.**",
            "To inform our efforts, a Yang administration will convene a food policy council with community representatives, farmers, distributors, independent restaurant owners, and other stakeholders to serve as a formal source of feedback and advice. We will also meet regularly with community members and provide a centralized platform for New Yorkers to direct complaints and feedback about food-related issues.",
            "**Develop better guidelines for equitable meal distribution & leverage H+H.**",
            "A Yang administration will also develop better guidelines for equitable meal distribution. Recent [studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11524-020-00476-0) have conducted geospatial analyses of the City's food resources, and this data is crucial for identifying areas in need. To improve our understanding of food insecurity in the City, Andrew will also encourage New York Health + Hospitals and other organizations in close contact with communities at risk of food insecurity to regularly screen for food insecurity.",
            "**Support New York's emergency food providers.**",
            "We will also help to create and maintain a public, timely dataset of all food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency food resources to help New Yorkers navigate our city's complex food relief ecosystem. We must encourage an accurate and up-to-date flow of information in an understandable format, which includes translation of educational materials and notices into the appropriate languages. There are tools out there, such as, [the Plentiful app](https://www.plentifulapp.com/), which allows people to find pantries and make reservations, the city should be working in tandem with these efforts. Increasing community access to fresh food is also crucial. A Yang administration will encourage the creation of food pantries in senior centers, community kitchens, and school gardens.",
            "**Expand availability of city meals.** ",
            "Due to the pandemic, [30%](https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/oversight-the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-snap-administration-food-pantries-and-soup-kitchens/#_ftn4) of shelters shut, in part because a large part of the volunteer workforce are older New Yorkers who needed to quarantine, causing long wait lines and food shortages at the remaining shelters. Andrew Yang will work with local nonprofits and community leaders to ensure that all New Yorkers in need can access city-provided meals. We must recruit and train both employees and volunteers able to handle excess capacity in times of crisis. As more New Yorkers get vaccinated, the City must prioritize reopening [shuttered](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/20/nyregion/nyc-food-banks.html) food banks to address the long wait times which can serve as a barrier to families in need. We also have to be creative in our solutions, including expanding drive-through pantry bag pick-ups, encouraging seniors-only distribution hours, and increasing the number of home delivery drivers. ",
            "### II) Improve the quality, nutrition, and cultural-appropriateness of City-provided meals",
            "**Continue to Implement \"Good Food Purchasing.\"**",
            "By centralizing oversight of City food programs and building local food infrastructure, a Yang administration will be able to more tightly control nutritional content and encourage bulk procurement, thus lowering costs. New York City government's food serving agencies serve approximately 230 million meals annually. According to[ Alexa Delwiche](https://goodfoodcities.org/how-new-york-city-is-revolutionizing-good-food-policy/), the Executive Director of the Center for Good Food Purchasing, \"New York City is one of the largest purchasers of food in the nation, second only to the Department of Defense. Good Food Purchasing, which is guided by the five principles of supporting local economies, a valued workforce, nutrition, environmental sustainability and animal welfare, will harness our city's enormous food procurement power to improve the local and regional food systems and maximize healthy options. Maximizing the [Good Food Purchasing](https://goodfoodcities.org/portfolio/new-york/) program will help us achieve this goal, as will uniform nutritional standards for City programs. ",
            "**Invest in healthy and quality meals for NYC students.**",
            "A Yang administration will ensure culturally-appropriate food options are available at all schools, such as kosher and halal meals. We will also raise awareness of summer meals programs and local resources for families in need. ",
            "Andrew Yang will also work with the School Construction Authority to build green roofs on school buildings and take other steps to incentivize on-site food production at schools to increase access to nutritious, fresh products. Wherever possible a Yang administration will instruct the DOE to work nutrition into its curriculum. For example, [Wellness in Schools (WITS)](https://www.wellnessintheschools.org/story/mission/), a national nonprofit that operates in some district schools provides a good model on how to teach children healthy eating habits in a way that is integrated with local food production and fun coursework. Andrew Yang will expand programs such as this. We will explore farm to school programs and work to strengthen food and nutrition education in our schools.  We will also encourage sustained relationships between food banks and schools - to support students at risk of food insecurity. ",
            "And, when schools are undergoing renovations, Andrew Yang will direct SCA and DOE to build enhanced cafeterias that allow for more open, inviting, social environments and display healthy foods prominently through food-court serving style. Educating our students on healthy eating habits is paramount to build life-long good habits that will increase mental and physical health over the students' lifetimes. ",
            "**Enhance emergency food distribution by emphasizing coordination, hot meals and healthy options.** ",
            "In 2017 [the City Council passed legislation](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2984602&GUID=5268FF91-55DD-4407-BF0A-53B7E330EF3E&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=food+portal) to create a food web portal that connects businesses, such as restaurants, supermarkets and religious organizations to nonprofits who serve food. The goal of the [donateNYC portal](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/donate/site/DonateFood/About) is to retrieve food that would otherwise be wasted and deliver it to our emergency food network. This is particularly important as a way to get hot meal donations from the city's restaurants for people who lack access to kitchens or are unable to cook for themselves, such as the homeless and seniors. A Yang administration will promote, market and expand this little known program and will ensure the portal is available on the NYC app. ",
            "Emergency food providers have organized to create a collective purchasing initiative to help get better, healthier products at better prices to communities. This work is extremely important. Programs such as the city's [Emergency Food Assistance Program](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hra/help/emergency-food-assistance-program.page) (EFAP), which has fortunately received baseline funding of $22 million, are not providing fresh and healthy food options, relying more on non-perishable products. According to the [West Side Campaign Against Hunger](https://www.wscah.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Advocating-to-change-EFAP-.pdf)'s 2021 testimony to the NYC Council, \"EFAP distributes $22 million of processed foods to New Yorkers in need. EFAP provides no options for fresh products nor any incentive to purchase New York State products.\" A Yang administration will follow the direction of those doing the work, such as WSCAH in their call to \"align EFAP with food-insecure New Yorkers' real needs\" by reinvigorating and reimagining EFAP, to operate \"on similar lines to HPNAP (The New York State Hunger Prevention and Nutrition Assistance Program), providing greater choice of products and incentive for more local purchasing. We must be committed to nutritional health and food choice in our emergency food networks. ",
            "### III) Aggressively target structural racism and inequity within our food system",
            "**Address systemic issues associated with food insecurity.**",
            "The Covid-19 pandemic exposed serious racial disparities in access to food, and within the food industry itself. Rates of food scarcity were three to four times [higher](https://nyshealthfoundation.org/2020/09/17/nyshealth-testimony-on-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-food-insecurity-in-new-york-state/) for Hispanic and Black New Yorkers than among white New Yorkers. Chinatown and other neighborhoods with high proportions of minority-owned businesses suffered [disproportionate restaurant closures](https://www.foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/view/903). Structural racism contributes to food insecurity in innumerable ways, from housing policy that reinforces food deserts to employment discrimination and wage theft against food sector employees. ",
            "A Yang administration will take a comprehensive approach to equity starting first with the representation of members of vulnerable communities in its administration and on advisory bodies, and regular engagement with local communities. We will work to address upstream causes of food insecurity, including reducing poverty with a Basic Income, [the largest municipal cash relief program in the country](https://www.yangforny.com/policies/a-basic-income-for-new-york-city). Andrew Yang will also increase investment in preventive health services, education, and social support services in vulnerable communities. In order to track the effectiveness of these policies and identify communities with the most need, we will also collect more comprehensive data on food security and nutrition-related inequities.",
            "**Make it easier for New Yorkers to participate in SNAP and WIC.**",
            "SNAP and WIC are crucial safety nets helping lower-income New Yorkers afford food. SNAP enrollment in New York City in April of 2020 [increased](https://nyshealthfoundation.org/2020/09/17/nyshealth-testimony-on-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-food-insecurity-in-new-york-state/) by the largest one-month jump ever-nearly 69,000 people-highlighting the level of reliance on these safety nets. A Yang administration will coordinate with New York State to create a streamlined process under which individuals can apply for several federal, state, and city-level safety net and nutrition programs simultaneously. Andrew Yang will also advocate for reforms to increase WIC and SNAP recipients' access to online grocery shopping and Farmer's Markets, including providing support to participating merchants themselves.",
            "Andrew Yang will focus outreach and educational initiatives on disproportionately-impacted communities. To identify areas with the most need, Andrew will advocate for data-sharing agreements among state and city agencies, and partner with local community leaders and nonprofits. We will also ensure the availability of language- and culturally-appropriate messaging and educational materials. ",
            "**Connecting CUNY students to SNAP.**",
            "Additionally, with rising costs of tuition, books and other school-related expenses, many CUNY students find themselves unable to afford food to eat. Students of color, older students, former foster youth, parenting students, students who experienced childhood food insecurity, and first generation college students are some of the students who are likely to experience food insecurity at some point in their studies. The Yang administration will work with CUNY to ensure that [students who are eligible for SNAP](https://www.cuny.edu/snap/) are enrolled. ",
            "**Ensure the equitable treatment of food workers.**",
            "Food workers are a critical piece of our City's infrastructure - our community could not survive or thrive without them. As essential workers on the frontlines, many of whom are employed by small businesses, food workers are also particularly vulnerable to health and economic crises. In fact, the food services industry [lost the most jobs](http://www.centernyc.org/reports-briefs/2021/3/25/nyc-job-losses-disproportionately-concentrated-in-manhattan) of any industry, due to COVID-19. To aid us in rebuilding this vital industry, a Yang administration will convene a focus group of food workers and other stakeholders to create a workforce development plan to improve working conditions and job security. We will also partner with labor advocacy organizations to monitor and vigorously enforce workplace safety, employment discrimination, and related regulations.",
            "While highly-capitalized restaurants were able to invest in COVID-19 safety measures, small businesses, many of which serve vulnerable communities, struggled. Many closed for good. Our City must give small businesses the financial support they need to invest in safety for both food workers and diners. For food workers laid off due to the pandemic, we will support programs that connect workers with businesses that are currently hiring. We will also expand access to training programs and education necessary for career advancement. Read more about Andrew Yang's plans to [support small businesses](https://www.yangforny.com/policies/relief-for-our-small-businesses) and revive the [restaurant industry](https://www.yangforny.com/policies/a-strong-recovery-for-nyc-restaurants-bars-and-eating-establishments).",
            "**Build sustainable local food capacity & incentivize the creation of supermarkets.**",
            "Andrew Yang's goal is to create a food system that is flexible and prepared to respond to future crises while providing stable access to both enough food and nutritious food. To strengthen our local food ecosystem, a Yang Administration will prioritize contracts to NYC-based food and hospitality businesses, and will fund and support food cooperatives and other community-based sources of food. ",
            "A Yang administration will expand the Food Retail Expansion and Support (FRESH Program). The [FRESH program](https://edc.nyc/program/food-retail-expansion-support-health-fresh) brings health and affordable food options to communities by lowering the costs of owning, leasing, developing and renovating supermarket retail space. Since launching in 2009, only 29 projects have been approved across the five boroughs. This program should be applied more widely to reduce food deserts and a Yang administration supports [current proposals by DCP](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/fresh/fresh-march-2021-update.pdf) to update the program through expansion of where Fresh is mapped; prevent clustering of FRESH supermarkets; changes to window installation and parking requirements. ",
            "Andrew will also seek to improve the quality of food in existing grocery stores. A [2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6561543/) study showed that the most dire need in communities is not access to supermarkets, but the quality and cost of the food in existing supermarkets and grocery stores. A Yang administration will expand work with groups such as [BronxWorks](https://nycitylens.com/fighting-the-food-deserts-bronx/), which partners with bodegas to highlight healthy options to their customers and runs educational programs about healthy lifestyles. ",
            "**Encourage local farms, farmers markets and community gardens.**",
            "We will also encourage the establishment and growth of local farms, in particular farms  owned by people of color and women.  To do so, a Yang administration will expand the GreenThumb program, make it easier to apply for licenses, and explore special zoning and financial incentives, including sales tax exemptions for farmers selling their produce. To ensure that this local food is available to New Yorkers, Andrew will expand local and regional food capacity, including rail and barge availability and mixed-use industrial activity within the City. ",
            "One key insight learned from our experience with the COVID-19 pandemic is the importance of online grocery orders and food delivery. We need to recruit and train a volunteer workforce that can rapidly mobilize in times of need, and that can reliably deliver food to vulnerable communities. Sustained investment is crucial, and we will take care that funding is stable and sufficient. Andrew Yang will also explore opportunities to expand local food infrastructure, such as the [Greenmarket Regional Food Hub](http://www.communityfoodfunders.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CFF-Presentation-on-GRFH-July-22-2015.pdf), to meet the scale of procurement.",
            "Community gardens are a vital resource for our neighborhoods. But for too long they have been put in precarious positions, at risk of being overrun at virtually any moment. Andrew Yang agrees that the city should negotiate more equitably on Community Licensing Agreements, for example, a Yang administration would reevaluate the \"termination-at-will\" clause to allow community gardens more stability. Andrew Yang also supports [existing legislation in the City Council](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4085858&GUID=17171A17-91EC-4BC9-86E9-8FB904244B4C&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=1653), sponsored by Council Member Ampry-Samuel that would require the parks department to collect and report data regarding community gardens reporting and permitting the sale of agriculture within community gardens. A Yang administration will focus on improving relationships between community gardens, supporting their work to nourish the local community, and inserting more stability in their licensing and arrangements.",
            "Additionally, Andrew Yang will ensure close partnerships with and greater funding for organizations like [GrowNYC](https://www.grownyc.org/), which bring greenmarkets into communities so that these resources are more widely accessible. ",
            "**Facilitate urban agriculture.**",
            "Andrew will pass a comprehensive urban agriculture plan and update the zoning codes in manufacturing districts, especially in low-income neighborhoods like Bushwick and Brownsville, to allow for safe commercial urban agriculture. To begin, we will convene a working group of community agriculture stakeholders to set detailed priorities and target milestones, including expanding the number of vertical farms and rooftop gardens across the City. For example, other cities, [such as Boston](https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/boston-urban-ag-vision-final_tcm3-52791.pdf), have put forth a comprehensive plan for urban agriculture. We will also partner with private businesses to increase the supply of land available for food production. To ensure that community members are aware of our efforts, we will work with community organizations and sustainable food stores to publicize details of the plan and our progress, and will publish an annual report on progress towards achieving our food milestones.",

            "The Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) is New York City at its finest. In the immediate years before COVID-19, SYEP provided high quality work experiences to [75,000 New York City youth](https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/how-much-might-youth-and-their-families-lose-in-wages-if-the-summer-youth-employment-program-is-canceled-nycbtn-june-2020.pdf), ages 14-24, each summer. SYEP runs for 6 weeks in July and August, with participants working up to 25 hours per week at $15/hour. With the help of community-based service providers, small businesses, teachers and school support, SYEP is the [largest youth employment program in the country](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dycd/services/jobs-internships/about-syep.page). ",
            "SYEP is a great introduction for young people into the workplace, as well as a valuable source of supplemental income - [85% of participants](https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/how-much-might-youth-and-their-families-lose-in-wages-if-the-summer-youth-employment-program-is-canceled-nycbtn-june-2020.pdf) live in households earning $31,000 or less. The program is an opportunity for youth to engage in their communities, find mentors, learn marketable skills and build professional experience during summer months. And, SYEP creates a natural moment for participants to start building financial literacy as well, with many receiving their first paychecks.",
            "[Studies show](https://www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/SYEP_Embedded_Full_Report_508_rev2.pdf) that SYEP has \"large impacts on young people's employment and earnings during the summer for which they applied, but it had little impact beyond that summer. Young people who won places in the program through the lottery were 54 percentage points more likely to be employed and earned $580 more during that summer, on average, than those who did not.\"",
            "In recent years, the program has scaled substantially, more than doubling from [36,000](https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/additional-funds-for-summer-youth-employment-but-uncertainties-remain-fopb-march-2019.pdf) participants in 2014. Last summer, however, much to the chagrin of New York families, teens, providers and elected officials, [the program was cut](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/nyregion/nyc-youth-summer-jobs-program.html) as a pandemic budget measure and then reinstated in modified, virtual form with a 50% reduction in available slots. This was a hard, last-minute hit to communities already reeling from COVID-19, and especially at a time when young people were facing grave economic uncertainty.",
            "The success of SYEP has been extended to the school year - the New York City Council has funded [Work, Learn Grow](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dycd/services/jobs-internships/work-learn-grow-employment-program.page), a $20 million program serving 5,000 New York City youth with year round employment opportunities in the public and private sectors. ",
            "A Yang administration will be committed to not only returning SYEP to its previous scale, but going further by continuing to grow the program, and at a faster pace than the city did in the five years before COVID. From 2014 to 2019, SYEP grew from 36,000 participants to 75,000, which meant that there was space for about half of the more than 150,000 applicants, with a lottery for the available spots. A Yang administration will also ensure that these jobs continue through the year, quintupling the size of Work, Learn, Grow to serve 25,000 youth year-round. ",
            "### Andrew Yang's Plan",
            "Where participation was previously growing by about 8,000 per year, a Yang administration would more than triple that growth rate to 25,000 per year with deep partnerships with the nonprofit and private sectors, as well as with City government. With this investment, SYEP would have 175,000 participants per summer by the end of a four-year term, meaning there would be enough room to accommodate the previous peak in applicants and **eliminating the lottery altogether.**",
            "Nonprofit organizations who work to administer SYEP know that we demand is high, and that meeting the needs of young people - with a four-year vision - is possible. However, the budget negotiation process that the Administration and City Council go through each year make it nearly impossible for providers to prepare for a growth in the program, while securing meaningful employment opportunities for young people. Youth employment advocates, after school providers, school leaders and SYEP host sites argue that with a clear plan for expansion, growing the program by 25,000 slots is not only possible, but it is necessary. ",
            "A Yang administration will ensure that the City fosters deep relationships with employers, small businesses, the critical nonprofit and human services sector, and government to meet the needs of young people through the school year and the summer months. To that end, a Yang administration will scale SYEP and WLG at the following levels:",
            "",
            "**Provider Support and Predictability**",
            "A Yang Administration will ensure that the many service providers who make SYEP and WLG possible will know how much funding they will be receiving year-over-year and how many slots they can plan for, well before program execution. Andrew Yang will also leverage local small businesses by conducting robust year-round outreach efforts to bring these employers into the program. ",
            "A Yang administration will also work with larger partners, especially companies who are investing in the future of New York, such as clean energy and technology companies, to make sure our youth get opportunities to learn skills that will support their educational and career development while contributing positively to a vision for a forward-thinking New York.",
            "**Simple Re-Enrollment**",
            "A Yang administration will ensure that young people do not need to complete a cumbersome enrollment process year after year to participate in SYEP. DYCD will retain enrollment information and simply ask them if they would like to participate in the program again the following summer at the time of SYEP recruitment. In doing so, the City will simplify the re-enrollment process, reducing the bar to entry for young people and their families. ",
            "**Program Size and Cost**",
            "Given in 2019, SYEP cost $164 million total, with $134 million coming from the city, Yang predicts brought to scale, this program would cost a total of $380 million by the end of year 4, with a commitment of $300 million from the city.",
            "A Yang administration will partner with WLG employment sites to subsidize the growth of year-round youth employment, leaning on private sector and philanthropic partners to subsidize the program at full capacity by 50%. To that end, WLG at 25,000 slots will cost the city an additional $30 million. ",
            "**Expanding Year-Round Employment Opportunities for Youth**",
            "Since FY16, the New York City Council has invested in year-round employment opportunities for young people age 16-19, Work, Learn Grow. At the cost of $20 million/year, 5,000 young people are served with a 25-week employment and professional development program. A Yang administration will also ensure that these jobs continue through the year, quintupling the size of Work, Learn, Grow to serve 25,000 youth year-round. ",
            "**A Year-Round Approach**",
            "While SYEP is a summer program, success for youth and employers requires a year-round approach. Employers need visibility as early as possible on how many participants they'll have funding for as they engage in their own internal interdepartmental planning. Youth need to know that there's room for them in opportunities that line up well with their interests and development goals. While SYEP is consistently oversubscribed, the program faces another issue of youth declining their slots because it takes so long for them to get accepted that, by the time they are, they've made other plans for their summers. This creates a lot of anxiety on all sides - employers who have worked hard against what's historically been unpredictable funding feel frustrated; youth are stressed by the last-minute scramble; and families that could benefit from the additional income through SYEP face financial uncertainty. Andrew will instruct DCYD and the DOE to engage providers on a year-long basis, inserting predictability and collaboration in the process to ensure the opportunities are maximized for providers, employers, and students. Yang will also instruct the DOE to engage students on a continuum to facilitate support for students throughout the school year. For example, when students return to their classrooms in the fall, teachers can build in reflections on their summer job opportunities and amplify opportunities for growth in the classroom using what students experienced over the summer. And likewise, in the lead up to the summer, students will work on resume building, interview skills and professional development.",
            "**Provide Quality Experiences for Students of All Backgrounds and Interests**",
            "New York City's youth population is diverse on every possible dimension. We have English language learners; we have youth with physical and learning disabilities; we have youth who live in our homeless shelters; we have youth at-risk of dropping out of school and falling into the criminal justice system; and more. And, the city is just as diverse in its employer base. A year-round program also means greater time and opportunity to properly match students with employers in situations that will best position them for success. We must do so in an inclusive and supportive manner by conducting outreach to all students, no matter their life or academic circumstances.",
            "And, we have a local economy (and national and global one) with evolving needs from its workforce. The city needs to work to continue to expand the SYEP employer base appropriately. Many tech companies of all sizes have workforces pushing their employers for more social engagement, which programs like SYEP can more than satisfy. And, yet, these organizations are underrepresented among SYEP employer participants. As SYEP has in the past to continue to match its employers against the always changing economy, proactive outreach is needed to bring more tech employers into partnership and help interested youth develop the skills of the future. Andrew Yang is ideally positioned to make these connections and leverage private sector employers of all kinds, especially tech companies.",
            "**Accountability: Measuring Success**",
            "While New York's SYEP is the largest, other cities around the nation have similar programs. [Research ](https://econofact.org/do-summer-youth-employment-programs-work)on similar youth employment programs, including New York City's, have shown that they are very effective in their primary objective of increasing youth employment and income. In this regard, the fact that many youth employment programs have operated as lottery programs is an interesting natural experiment; applicants who make it through the lottery have meaningfully greater rates of summer employment and meaningfully more summer income than those who don't. Summer youth employment programs have also been consistently tied to lower youth crime - 30-40% lower youth crime rates in the 16 months after program participation from research in Boston and Chicago. Unfortunately, have not yet been connected to better long-term employment outcomes. Researchers have speculated that this may be in part because of the budgetary uncertainty under which these programs operate, and the scramble that creates - tossing up obstacles for youth trying to find experiences relevant to their interests and employers working to create quality opportunities. In addition, the uncertainty of the lottery means a person participating in the lottery in multiple years is likely to end up with resume gaps in their summer experiences. A year-round approach to SYEP will help on these fronts by inserting structure and predictability, and therefore justify a Yang administration's focus on also expanding Work, Learn, Grow.",
            "A Yang administration would also instruct DCYC to collect more granular data, analytics and qualitative information looking at these questions by employer and employer type to see if particular experiences are setting up participants for longer-term success to identify best practices that can be scaled across all SYEP employers. Also of interest might be pilots giving some randomly selected participants a summer cash stipend for independent pursuits, possibly scaled up to reflect the administrative costs of SYEP, to see what impact that alternative program design has on participant satisfaction and outcomes.",

            "- Spark competition in the money services business sector;\n- Aggregate demand for remittance services and negotiate with incumbents like Moneygram and Western Union provide bulk discounts;\n- Help immigrants open bank accounts at CDFIs and other banks to enable cheaper digital overseas transfers and save money; and \n- Work with banks to offer low-cost remittance services as part of community reinvestment act activities.",
            "##### 1. Spark competition in the money services business sector",
            "Today, new financial technology companies are entering the market, offering remittance transfers that are anywhere from 50% to 90% cheaper than the high prices charged by incumbents. Fees are so high in part because the New York State legislature protects the incumbents, like Western Union and Moneygram, by requiring potential competitors to go through an extensive licensing process. For example, in New Jersey, the money service business licensing process typically takes 3 months. In New York, it takes between one year and two years, and New York State requires new competitors to put up significant capital as collateral. New York State lawmakers also work to actively support incumbents by barring money service businesses from [locating within three-tenths of a mile](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/BNK/374) of one another. ",
            "That's why Andrew Yang is calling on the state legislature to (a) provide for money service business license reciprocity with neighboring states and (b) reduce regulatory burdens and commit to a more rapid permitting process for money service businesses for the future.",

            "Companies like Moneygram and Western Union negotiate with partners and offer bulk discounts to their customers. For example, Uber drivers get a 5% discount on Moneygram's services. The People's Bank will negotiate on behalf of New York City residents for bulk discounts. ",
            "##### 3. Help immigrants (and other New Yorkers) open bank accounts to enable cheaper digital overseas transfers and save money",
            "As Mayor, Yang will build on the work of New York City's Office of Financial Empowerment to get more banks to accept ID NYC and ITINs instead of SSNs. The People's Bank's Stamp of Approval will require banks to accept ID NYC and ITINs. That will help more immigrants get bank accounts and enter the financial mainstream, which will open up lower cost options for remittances. More broadly, the People's Bank will work with CDFIs to bring more consumers into the mainstream financial sector, including encouraging recipients of Municipal Basic Income checks to open savings and checking accounts.

            "New York City is already grappling with the impacts of a changing climate. Each year, 130 New Yorkers die because of heat exposure, mostly in vulnerable communities lacking air conditioning. Almost a decade after Superstorm Sandy, the City remains highly vulnerable to storm surges. Outdated stormwater management systems are inadequate and when a big rain hits, low income neighborhoods in places like southeast Queens are flooded. The City's current energy infrastructure negatively impacts lower-income communities and communities of color. For example, in the Hunts Point neighborhood of the Bronx, emergency room visits for children with asthma are double the citywide rate. ",
            "Today in NYC, almost 75% of our electricity still comes from fossil fuel. While[ Local Law 97](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/local_laws/ll97of2019.pdf) is groundbreaking legislation aimed at reducing our reliance on greenhouse gas emissions, under current plans [we will still be sourcing at least half of our electricity from dirty power plants in 2030](https://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/OneNYC-2050-A-Livable-Climate.pdf). We need a greater sense of urgency.

            "**5. Educate the next generation on climate change.** ",
            "Local Law 97 currently requires a reduction in total citywide emissions of 40% below the 2005 baseline by 2030. Andrew's plan will accelerate the City's progress, putting New York on a path to reach 50% reductions by 2030, in line with President Biden's recent Earth Day commitment.",
            "**Shift to an 80% clean energy grid by deploying solar, expanding battery storage, and supporting offshore wind production**",
            "### Wind, Hydro and Transmission ",
            "**Double down on wind deployment:** Accelerate current efforts by working with clean energy developers, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New York State government, and the federal government to invest in port and transportation infrastructure around the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal; site, permit, fund and equip additional assembly sites; and launch a new offshore wind job training program at a CUNY college. ",
            "**Rapidly permit transmission line projects and upgrade interconnection sites:** There are major projects underway to bring clean hydro and wind power from upstate New York, Canada, and surrounding states into New York City. The bottleneck for these projects is siting and permitting the transmission. For example, the Champlain Hudson Power Express project will bring power from Hydro Quebec to New York City, but has spent the better part of a decade getting permitted - and still hasn't been able to start construction. Andrew will get shovels in the ground on these projects to take advantage of the abundant sources of clean energy in the surrounding regions. As part of this effort, the City will also work with ConEdison and merchant transmission companies to site, permit and rezone land where necessary to upgrade existing and build new electric transmission interconnection sites.",
            "### Solar",
            "Studies show that New York City can generate up to [5 gigawatts of solar energy](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/science/earth/16solar.html), enough to power almost half of the city's daytime peak demands. Today, however, the city generates only 250 megawatts, or about 5% of its capacity. As Mayor, Andrew will: ",
            "**Work with state government, Public Service Commission, NYISO and ConEdison to support an additional 500 megawatts of community solar:** Community solar installations are one important tool to help the City realize its solar potential. In 2015, the Public Service Commission and ConEdison enabled community solar, but effectively capped community solar production in New York City at 350 megawatts. That cap is already 90% utilized by completed projects and projects under development. Yang is calling for adding an additional 500 megawatts to provide for 50 megawatts of community solar installation per year for the next decade.",
            "**Convert major landfills and brownfield sites across New York City to Community Solar Installations:** Our city has thousands of commercial and industrial \"brownfield\" properties that are chronically vacant, underutilized or environmentally contaminated. As Mayor, Andrew will survey these sites and dedicate feasible lots to community solar, beginning with Edgemere Landfill. Edgemere Landfill was the longest continuously used landfill in the country, operating from 1938 to 1991. Over the course of 53 years, once vibrant wetlands were turned into a toxic waste dump. As Mayor, Yang will give it new life as a solar power generating project that can help turn the tide against climate change. ",
            "**Bring ConEdison to the negotiating table to simplify the interconnection approval and permitting process:** One of the big barriers for solar installations - and for battery storage - is getting approval from ConEdison for an interconnection to the grid, a process that can take 18 months. The climate crisis can't afford that kind of bureaucracy. Yang will bring ConEdison, solar developers, and battery storage developers to the table and hammer out a simpler, faster process for approving and building interconnections. ",
            "**Work with the state legislature to enable community solar projects built outside of New York City to benefit New York City residents:** Even after deploying solar on all economically feasible locations in New York City, many low-income communities will still not be able to benefit from cheaper, cleaner, electricity from community solar projects. Yang is joining the New York Solar Energy Industries Association in calling for the elimination of regulatory barriers that limit membership in community solar projects to projects sited in the same utility territory. Current policy should be updated to enable cross-utility crediting i.e. the transfer of bill credits across utilities. Addressing this arbitrary barrier could enable solar access for more than 500,000 New York City households. ",
            "**Reform the permitting process for rooftop solar installation:** The Yang Administration will digitize the permitting process for rooftop solar (as part of a broader permitting reform push) and grant conditional building permits to reduce soft costs for developers. ",
            "**Enable property owners to access PACE financing:** Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing is a low-cost mechanism for property owners to make energy-efficiency upgrades that is available in states and cities across the country but not yet in New York City. The current Administration committed to launching PACE in New York City in 2021, but to date, not action has been taken. Yang will resolve outstanding regulatory issues and make PACE available in his first year in office. ",
            "### Battery Storage ",
            "**Overhaul the permitting process for battery storage and commit city-owned land to battery storage projects:** As [NYSERDA has highlighted,](https://yangforny.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fc3fa5461264b980b31b5b614&id=154b8dfa10&e=00ae1930ab) green projects, such as battery energy storage solutions, are essential to a resilient and reliable power grid, the adoption of sustainable energy generation, and a clean energy economy**.** Technologies such as these are the way forward to create jobs and sustain our environment. But the battery storage projects have been bogged down in the City's convoluted permitting process, which requires multiple overlapping reviews by as many as four separate agencies, much of which is still conducted through the exchange of letters. Andrew Yang will streamline the permitting process for green energy projects, including battery storage and will commit city owned-land to them. During Andrew's first term, he'll put the city on a path to have 1.5 gigawatts of distributed energy storage. [Read more about Andrew's announcement](https://www.yangforny.com/policies/building-our-way-into-the-21st-century) on battery storage energy and jobs.",
            "### Mobilize Private Investment",
            "Andrew is also calling for public and private pension, endowment and other fund managers based in New York City to swiftly divest from fossil fuel industries and reallocate capital to the green economy. As Mayor, he will bring together CEOs of leading financial institutions to encourage commitments to investing in green, job creating industries, especially here in New York City, and use new financing tools, like green bonds, to raise capital directly for sustainability-focused city infrastructure projects.",
            "### **Reduce Building Energy Use and other Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions**",
            "**Municipal building retrofits:** Prioritize installing solar panels on municipally owned buildings and on public housing wherever feasible. Many of these installations can be financed by private investors if the City can commit to expediting permits and approvals. Andrew will also look for non-traditional sites to deploy solar, like over city landfills. Andrew will also retrofit public buildings and public housing projects to reduce enerygy emissions, for example by deploying new technologies that maximize the efficiency of steam heating systems. Again, many of these projects can be privately financed or financed by state entities like the NYGreen Bank. ",
            "**Enforce the requirements of Local Law 97:** The first compliance deadline for Local Law 97 falls on May 1, 2025, during what will be Andrew's third year as Mayor. Landlords will be pushing to dial down the climate emission reduction targets. As Mayor, Andrew will insist that owners follow through to meet the goals of the Climate Mobilization Act. At the same time, he will position the City as a partner to help commercial and residential property owners and managers make the transition away from dirty fuels and towards fully electrified building systems.  For example, he will use the City's own buildings as demonstration projects for how landlords and building owners can meet the emissions reductions requirements and will advocate for state and federal tax credits to offset costs. He will also scale up Community Retrofit NYC so that all neighborhoods benefit from greener, cleaner buildings. These retrofits will create thousands of jobs. Andrew will also advance common sense steps to reduce carbon emissions and improve quality of life, like expanding the NYC CoolRoofs program. ",
            "**Community retrofits:** Scale up the Community Retrofit NYC program to ensure that vulnerable communities see the benefits of building efficiency (lower utility bills and improved housing quality).",
            "**Build a citywide EV charging system and electrify the city's vehicle fleet:** Work with Con Edison and the private sector to deploy electric charging stations across New York City, accelerating the broader adoption of EVs and creating jobs in the process. Charging stations will be driven by renewable energy sources. To lead by example, Andrew will set the City on pace to electrify the City's vehicle fleet by 2035.",
            "**Establish Commercial Waste Zones:** Commercial Waste Zones are critical to reducing congestion and corresponding emissions as well as driving the city towards an ideal state of zero waste. Implementation of Local Law 199 is an important step in achieving this goal. The law calls for the Department of Sanitation to divide the city into 20 zones and then to issue RFPs to select three to five carters for each zone. Carters would award long-term contracts and in return would be required to develop zero waste plans and support waste reduction and recycling. As mayor, Andrew Yang will draw on his experience as a successful entrepreneur who has built businesses and nonprofits, to mobilize a team to execute on these important priorities. Andrew will work closely with the Department of Sanitation to implement this law in the first term, while soliciting community input into the mapping of the zones and into the specific requirements on the carters. Further, Andrew will commit to expanding programs like DSNY's Curbside Composting program, the Compost Project's community composting sites and GrowNYC Zero Waste Program, which manages residential food scrap drop-off sites at Green Markets. Such efforts will give New Yorkers the tools they need to engage in proper recycling of organic waste. ",
            "**Implement Congestion pricing:** As Mayor, Andrew Yang will work with the Governor, our federal delegation and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to ensure congestion pricing moves forward immediately, which will inject badly needed funding into New York City's subway and bus capital plans and reduce vehicular traffic. ",
            "### Protect Vulnerable Neighborhoods from a Changing Climate",
            "**Mitigate the Heat Island Effect:** Expand the successful CoolRoofs program, which can reduce building temperatures by up to 30% by covering roofs with light-reflective membranes; add additional 'cooling centers' throughout the city; and dramatically step up the planting of street trees, which both provide shade, reduce ambient air temperature, and help reduce New York's carbon footprint. Mandate climate-friendly building codes for new developments and require retrofits for already-existing buildings; and Paint streets lighter colors",

Recent [estimates](https://ascpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13722-018-0117-1) suggest that roughly 20 million American adults need treatment for a substance use disorder, and that only 10.8% are receiving the care they need. It is both unjust and bad policy to approach under-treatment with over-criminalization. Andrew Yang recognizes that \"tough on crime\" drug policies are not only insufficient, ineffective, and inhumane - they are also not helping those with addiction heal. This is evidenced by the fact that more overdose deaths were [recorded](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p1218-overdose-deaths-covid-19.html) in the year ending in May 2020 than ever before. ",
            "A Yang administration will take a public health approach to treating addiction, expanding successful programs that replace criminalization - which only [compounds](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/10/12/us-disastrous-toll-criminalizing-drug-use#) the negative effects of substance abuse - with comprehensive social and medical services to put struggling New Yorkers on the path to recovery.

            "**1. Expand the Heroin Overdose Prevention & Education (\"HOPE\") Program to every borough**. The HOPE Program launched in Staten Island in 2017 to divert those arrested for low-level substance-related crimes to treatment rather than being sent to jail. The post-arrest and pre-arraignment program allows participants to clear their arrest record by meeting with a licensed counselor at one of the programs' designated Resource and Recovery Centers within seven days of the date of their release for an assessment, developing a service plan, and engaging in services within 37 days post-arrest. A [report](http://criminaljustice.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/HOPE-Report-2.19.pdf) from Metis Associates commissioned by the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice found that HOPE participants were considerably less likely to be rearrested than a comparison population (19% vs. 44%). A Yang administration will expand the HOPE Program to all five boroughs and ensure the program includes additional misdemeanors like petit larceny, trespassing, possession of hypodermic needles, and other non-violent charges. A Yang administration will also ensure that program participants have access to additional services, such as supportive housing and other wraparound services, as needed.",

Under [State law](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/220.45), syringe possession is a Class-A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail. This sort of criminalization only serves to push those who are struggling with addiction away from the services they need, such as New York City's [successful](https://www.cdc.gov/policy/hst/hi5/cleansyringes/index.html) syringe exchange program. A Yang administration will lean heavily on the Democrat-controlled State Legislature to decriminalize syringe possession so that New Yorkers feel comfortable accessing potentially life-saving services. In addition, a Yang administration will direct the NYPD to focus on violent crime rather than on criminalized behaviors that don't pose a public safety risk, especially when such behaviors have [proven](https://gothamist.com/news/nypds-enforcement-marijuana-laws-still-plagued-extreme-racial-disparities) to be enforced disproportionately against Black and brown New Yorkers.",

OPCs have been [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5308167/) to significantly reduce overdose deaths in surrounding neighborhoods among other public health benefits like reduced syringe sharing and increased uptake of addiction treatment, with no corresponding increase in community drug use. While the NYC Department of Health released a [report](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/public/supervised-injection-report.pdf) calling for the creation of OPCs in 2017, a proposal to implement OPCs at four locations in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx has since stalled. A Yang administration will immediately authorize the implementation of OPCs at the sites already designated by the DOH and seek to identify additional sites for OPCs where the need is greatest across all five boroughs.",

Buprenorphine is a critical component of the public health response to the opioid epidemic and a Yang administration will ensure that it is affordable and accessible to all who need it by working with NYC Health + Hospitals to increase the number of buprenorphine-prescribing doctors and incentivizing doctors to work at MAT (medication-assisted treatment) opioid abuse treatment facilities.",

Neighborhood Action Centers are neighborhood-based one-stop shops that bring together health care providers, New York City agencies, and community-based organizations and programs under one roof.

In return, the city should be obligated to provide residents outdoor, green space that allows people to be in nature and families a place to bring their children. Parks and open space is a vital resource for our culture, climate and socialization. It's where families come for picnics, kids play sports, tourists buy hot dogs. ",
            "During the pandemic, parks were people's saving grace, providing cherished spaces to get fresh air, exercise and socially distance. More than just amenities, parks became necessities for many New Yorkers living for days on end in cramped dwellings. But the pandemic also brought into focus the fact that not all parks are created equally and like many inequities, our city's poorest residents do not have access to green spaces. In fact, at the height of the pandemic, more than [1.1 million New Yorkers did not have access](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/nyregion/nyc-parks-access-governors-island.html) to any park within a 10-minute walk of their homes. The average park size in poor neighborhoods is 6.4 acres compared to 14 acres in wealthy neighborhoods. Because of the piecemeal approach to designing parks, small parks and playgrounds are squeezed between buildings; lacking sufficient amenities to get exercise and enjoy nature, particularly in Black and brown communities. ",

            "### I) Fund Parks and Generate Revenue",
            "##### Restore funding to the parks budget.",
            "New Yorkers care deeply about open spaces. Unfortunately, parks are often the first casualty in budget cuts. The New York City parks department is chronically underfunded and understaffed. According to [New Yorkers for Parks (NY4P)](http://www.ny4p.org/client-uploads/pdf/Other-reports/2020_BuildingtheFutureofNewYorkParksandOpenSpace.pdf) the Parks Department oversees 14 percent of the city's land, but consistently receives less than one percent of the expense budget and six percent of the capital budget. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Parks Department budget of $540 million was cut by [nearly $85 million](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/budget-cuts-leave-nyc-parks-dirtier-and-more-run-down-city-residents-complain/2572329/) and the seasonal workforce of 1,700 people was not hired over the summer. This left thousands without jobs, including the loss of nearly [200 staff members](http://www.ny4p.org/client-uploads/pdf/Other-reports/2020_BuildingtheFutureofNewYorkParksandOpenSpace.pdf) like Parks Enforcement Patrol Officers, leaving parks in disarray as[ trash and litter overflowed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/nyregion/nyc-parks-trash.html). At the same time, [other major cities](http://www.ny4p.org/client-uploads/pdf/Other-reports/2020_BuildingtheFutureofNewYorkParksandOpenSpace.pdf) like Los Angeles and Chicago allocate between two and four percent of their expense budget to parks. Parks are an essential public good and should be valued as such. Andrew Yang will restore the parks budget to its full funding in his first year.",
            "##### Expand the city's organic waste collection program and composting sites.",
            "Organics make up 1/3 of the city's waste, which when dumped in landfills produces the dangerous greenhouse gas, methane. Unfortunately, despite the clear environmental impact, the city's composting program has long taken a back seat to other issues. In 2018, de Blasio curtailed the expansion of the program to underserved neighborhoods and early in the pandemic, he suspended public funding for the program, including DSNY's Curbside Composting program, the Compost Project's community composting sites and GrowNYC Zero Waste Program, which manages residential food scrap drop-off sites at Green Markets. While the City Council restored [$2.7 million](http://www.cafeteriaculture.org/save-our-compost-nyc.html) July 2020 for community composting operations it was only a shell of the original $28 million that was cut from the budget. On Earth Day 2021, Mayor de Blasio announced the city would restore the program, but there are [several new caveats](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2021/04/22/city-plans-to-restore-organic-waste-pickup-program-1377115): landlords will now need to enroll to be included, there is no plan for expansion to the myriad of underserved neighborhoods, and he is not fulfilling his promise to achieve a citywide mandate. We must commit to expanding these programs and giving New Yorkers the tools they need to engage in proper recycling of organic waste. Andrew Yang strongly supports improving New York's waste disposal and knows we must do so in a cost effective way. Currently, the city does not provide composting bins in much of the [Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/nyregion/nyc-compost-recycling.html). Leaving our poorer neighborhoods and communities of color from its trash reduction initiatives is outrageous. These communities are disproportionately impacted both by climate change to which current policies contribute, and are typically nearer to major arteries that trash trucks use on their way in and out of the city. Under a Yang Administration, the city will make composting accessible to those who want it, regardless of where they live. Andrew will execute this across the four years of his first term. He will start by assembling a task force to understand the greatest issues with the current program and determine where expansion is most needed. Next, the city will launch pilot programs in the identified neighborhoods, then expand on a large scale ultimately achieving city wide collection with the eventual goal of mandatory composting. A central aspect of this expanded program will be increased community outreach; by informing more New Yorkers about the benefits of composting, and proving to them it is easy to do, we can increase the impact of each dollar the city spends on collection and transportation.",
            "##### Allow NYC Parks to collect concession revenue. ",
            "Yang supports [calls by NY4P](http://www.ny4p.org/client-uploads/pdf/Other-reports/2020_BuildingtheFutureofNewYorkParksandOpenSpace.pdf) to amend the city charter so NYC Parks can keep at least part, if not all, of its concession revenue. Currently the charter states that all city revenues are to be paid into the general fund. This means the vast majority of parks cannot retain revenue earned in park concessions, such as restaurants, golf courses and marinas, which in 2019 raised [$70](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/operations/downloads/pdf/mmr2019/2019_mmr.pdf) million. Given the oncoming budget shortfalls, it will be more important than ever to allow parks to retain the funds they earn from concessions. ",

            "Schoolyards are natural sites to spark full-scale community transformation that often go unused outside of school hours. A green schoolyard can serve as a hub for community empowerment, improved health, education and climate resiliency. But New York City averages only 2.1 playgrounds per 10,000 people, a ratio that lags behind 68 of the 100 most populous cities. And many of our playgrounds are outdated, asphalt and concrete structures without green space and other amenities. We can do better.",
            "Andrew Yang will continue successful public-private partnerships, such as mobilizing the Trust for Public Land (TPL), which has worked with NYC Parks, the Department of Education and the School Construction Authority to transform over 200 schoolyards into vibrant community spaces. The TPL collaborates with students, creating a sense of shared ownership in the resulting park: \"This schoolyard demonstrates the value of student voices. Watching our ideas take shape right outside the windows of our classroom has given us a huge sense of pride\" [said a 5th grader](https://www.tpl.org/sites/default/files/Strategic_Plan_12.23.pdf) at P.S. 213K. Working with partners like these, a Yang administration will build 100 new green schoolyards over his first administration.

            "- **Dedicate DOT, Park Department or other city personnel to open streets in neighborhoods that do not have BIDs or established community groups that cannot dedicate volunteer support to Open Streets without a dedicated network of  neighborhood organizers.** This is an equity issue: communities should not be precluded from this program because they do not have a BID or organized community group who is willing to apply for and run the program. While several Open Streets have strong community engagement and local volunteer organizers, many do not. The Department of Transportation will provide the resources and workers to block off the street, arrange barricades, and work with neighborhoods to tailor the hours and days that the streets should be open.",
            "- **Create a simple application process with automatic annual renewals for existing and new streets.** Neighborhood groups should not have to go through a bureaucratic mess to maintain or open an Open Street. Once a group has registered with the DOT, there will be automatic renewals. Only the hours and days will need to be updated with the DOT so there is a central website providing current information for interested individuals and businesses.",

The Yang campaign has previously released proposals for \"lending\" outdoor adjacent space to restaurants.

We must reimagine our city's streets so they are more pedestrian and bike friendly while helping to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Andrew Yang supports the vision put out by the [Regional Plan Association](https://rpa.org/work/reports/the-five-borough-bikeway) for a \"Five Borough Bikeway,\" which will create a city-wide network of protected, continuous, high-capacity, priority bike lanes. ",
            "- **More Equitable Pedestrian Plazas** New York City has over [72 pedestrian plazas](https://nylcv.org/news/pedestrian-plazas-nyc/), serving local communities by increasing street safety, boosting local businesses and encouraging walking -- resulting in clear environmental benefits. DOT's larger vision is to have a pedestrian plaza within a 10 minute walk of every New Yorker, unfortunately, NYC is very far from this vision. Pedestrian plazas are clustered in lower Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn with only  1/4  found in other boroughs, leaving lower income neighborhoods underserved. In 2015, the city announced the [OnePlaza Equity Program](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2015/11/23/trottenberg-announces-plaza-equity-program-at-plaza-de-las-americas-reveal/#:~:text=Trottenberg%20announced%20the%20OneNYC%20Plaza,the%20Bronx%2C%20and%20Upper%20Manhattan), promising to invest $1.4 million in maintenance and management assistance of plazas in 30 medium to high need areas. This is important as plazas that lack care and maintenance can fall out of favor, eradicating the inherent benefits and once again underutilizing public space. The city is currently [advertising](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/nyc-plaza-program.shtml) for small business owners and vendors who can create concessions and markets in plazas. A Yang Administration will build on the current OnePlaza Equity Program to ensure new pedestrian plaza projects are prioritized in underserved neighborhoods, backing the projects beyond completion to ensure they are properly maintained and encourage new local business opportunities. Yang will also seek out MWBE as vendors and operators for plaza businesses and will work with communities to bring cultural events such as movie screenings, small concerts and food trucks to the plazas that will stimulate economic activity and recreation.

In fact, due to lack of maintenance, many facilities cannot be used until they have been repaired, leaving teams without a field and kids without easily accessible activities. Andrew Yang will invest in the repair and continued maintenance of the public facilities that are so important to NYC communities, while also looking for opportunities to build new facilities within parks to keep up with the growing demand.

The [Regional Plan Association](https://rpa.org/work/reports/time-to-act) has identified the potential for NYCHA and the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) to turn this land into larger community assets to be managed by the DPR. There are existing successes of City run parks on NYCHA land that are key resources for the surrounding community. The city has spent hundreds of millions of dollars acquiring land for new projects when there is already so much space ripe for transformation in the heart of communities who need it most.

            "- **The QueensWay, Queens.** For over ten years, residents, organizations and local leaders have been planning and advocating to convert the Rockaway Beach Branch, spanning from Rego Park to Ozone Park, into a park. Since 1962, this 3.5 mile stretch of tracks--double the length of The Highline--has been owned by the city but has been sitting abandoned. [The Friends of the QueensWay](https://www.thequeensway.org/) and The Trust for Public Land have developed a comprehensive plan that connects several parks, contributes to Vision Zero goals, brings economic opportunity and tourism and improves the health and quality of life for Queens residents. [According to NY4P](http://www.ny4p.org/client-uploads/pdf/Other-reports/2020_BuildingtheFutureofNewYorkParksandOpenSpace.pdf), the QueensWay plan was released in 2014 and renderings of the first half-mile section were released three years later. The MTA conducted a study evaluating the costs associated with reactivating a stretch of the track in eastern Queens, [finding that it would cost](https://ny.curbed.com/2019/10/9/20906811/rockaway-beach-branch-lirr-subway-feasibility-study) $6.7 billion to reactivate, and $8.1 billion to connect the stretch to the subway. Yang is sensitive to the need to improve transportation in this area including increasing the number of buses per hour, but given the infeasibility of reactivating the line and the need for park land in these communities, a Yang administration will commit to seeing this plan through to fruition. Moreover, investing in the QueensWay will enable multi-modal transportation, such as safe walking and bike paths and will enhance access to the neighboring bus stops, and 7 subway lines. The 3.5 mile project would cost approximately $150 million while the [first two phases](https://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/caseconsortium/casestudies/128/casestudy/www/layout/case_id_128_id_903.html#_ftn2) of the 1.45 mile long High Line cost $152 million, of which $30 million was raised by Friends of the High Line. Just four years after the first section of the high line opened, the city valued the economic benefit of it at close to $1  billion - 5 times its expected value. The QueensWay will bring recreation, climate benefits, safety, tourism and economic stimulus to the surrounding neighborhoods of Eastern Queens. ",
            "- **Freshkills Park, Staten Island.** Closed as a landfill in 2001, [Freshkills Park](https://www.nycgovparks.org/park-features/freshkills-park/about-the-site) is the largest park to be developed in NYC in over a century. Since 2012, NYC Parks has completed small projects along the park's edge, closest to the community, yet leaving most of the land unusable. When fully developed, Freshkills will be the second-largest park in NYC and almost three times the size of Central Park. The rehabilitation of the ecosystem will not only provide amazing open space for New Yorkers, but is also important for controlling and filtering stormwater and bringing back wildlife that hasn't been seen in decades. The park is being completed in phases, with only three areas currently open to the public. In order to complete the full transformation of Freshkills by 2036, the city must provide consistent funding and support for the development of the parks. A Yang administration will push forward the South Park and East Park developments to provide much needed park amenities in Staten Island. A Yang administration will [support the vision](http://www.ny4p.org/client-uploads/pdf/Other-reports/2020_BuildingtheFutureofNewYorkParksandOpenSpace.pdf) for bringing trails, greenways, recreational fields and overlook stations and will facilitate a NYC Parks and Freshkills Park Alliance as they actively seek funding.",

The park gained popularity, attracting media attention and thousands of small donors and supporters to help make it a reality, but in recent years, the group has hit speed bumps delaying progress. A Yang administration would engage with the Lowline designers to gauge the benefit it would provide to the community and how we could expand the idea to other boroughs. New York City is desperately in need of more public parks but with scarce supply of suitable open space, we must look at every idea and modern technology to convert underutilized land throughout the city.",

The idea was so exciting that [Time magazine](https://techland.time.com/2013/11/14/the-25-best-inventions-of-the-year-2013/slide/the-plus-pool/) labeled it one of \"the 25 best inventions of 2013.\" The city's Economic Development Corporation even issued a [request for expression of interest (RFEI)](https://ny.curbed.com/2019/9/19/20873767/nyc-floating-filtered-east-river-pool-edc), soliciting ideas on how a floating pool could be built. Ten years later, however, the city has not moved forward with any of the proposals. Now is the time to think big and reimagine our public assets--including our streets, parks and waterways--especially when there is significant will by the private sector to develop and fund groundbreaking proposals. A Yang administration will revive this concept and work with invested parties to bring the city's first self-filtering, floating swimming pool to our shores with particular emphasis on an appropriate **location of the pool in relation to access and equity.** The +POOL is [estimated to cost $25 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/05/style/plus-pool-east-river.html#:~:text=It%20took%20more%20than%20a,through%20a%20public%2Dprivate%20partnership.), which is slated to be raised through a public-private partnership. We must also restore existing swimming public pools and open inground pools in communities that need them as part of a broader equity approach. ",
            "##### Expand arts and cultural programming in our parks. ",
            "Before the pandemic, outdoor movie screenings, concerts and performances in parks were a major source of entertainment. The next Mayor should build on legislation recently passed by the City Council that establishes an **\"Open Culture\" program,** which temporarily allows eligible cultural and art institutions and venues to use approved open public street space for cultural events. A Yang administration will look to make this program permanent and will promote performances through our NYC App so all New Yorkers are aware of the happenings in our city.",
            "We must also expand cultural programming in our parks. To that end, we have proposed a new program, **Broadway to the People,** that would work with artists to mount theater productions in public parks at reduced fees, similar to Shakespeare in the Park. This will allow more New Yorkers to partake in the magic of Broadway and provide financial support to theaters as they begin turning the lights back on. It's encouraging that nearly a year into the pandemic, the city and state are now providing structural support for public arts programming, such as the state's [PopsUp festival](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-marshals-return-performing-arts-new-york-ny-popsup) that will bring live events to public spaces throughout the state. These creative solutions are wise and essential to bringing back the cultural pulse of our city and we will ensure that programming serves the needs of local artists who most need the work. Along with the featured local artists, famous New Yorkers would be invited back to perform in their old neighborhoods, even beyond the pandemic, and all New Yorkers would be encouraged to reconnect with their neighbors.",

            "The last year has been tough for almost all businesses, but New York's world class restaurants, bars and nightlife establishments have been hit especially hard. It is estimated that as many as 5,000 bars and restaurants have already closed and an [audit conducted by the State Comptroller,](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/pdf/nyc-restaurant-industry-final.pdf) the next year could see as many as one-third of NYC's bars and restaurants shutter, resulting in the loss of as many as 12,000 city restaurant jobs and 159,000 industry jobs. Restaurants and hospitality venues are crucial to the revitalization of our local economies and rebuilding the vibrancy of our neighborhoods. In 2019, NYC's restaurant industry had 23,650 establishments, provided 317,800 jobs and paid $10.7 billion in total wages in addition to nearly $27 billion in taxable sales. But these establishments are still being hampered by nonsensical pandemic-era regulations. Andrew Yang is calling on the state legislature and the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to do right by NYC's cherished bars and restaurants by removing bureaucratic obstacles in their way. ",
            "##### Allow for temporary liquor licenses to be granted to businesses in NYC, the same standard as the rest of the state.",
            "According to recent [reporting in the NY Post](https://nypost.com/2021/04/21/state-liquor-law-keeping-nyc-eateries-from-covid-recovery/), under current law, new or revived restaurants and pubs *outside* of new York City can obtain a temporary liquor permit within 30 days, while the State Liquor Authority reviews an applicant's request for full license-- a process that could take anywhere from four to six months. Yet NYC establishments are not eligible for a temporary liquor license. Allowances being made in some parts of the state should be applied in NYC as well. This is especially in an industry where alcohol sales make up 30-40% of revenue and preventing businesses from accessing a liquor license could be a death knell. Allowing for temporary licensure for NYC establishments while they await their full license will enable these venues to reopen their doors, re-hire their staff and contribute to our local economy. An establishment would only get a temporary license after meeting with their local Community Board, meaning there is no threat of circumventing local safeguards and the SLA would still retain its enforcement power. Andrew Yang encourages the SLA to make NYC bars and restaurants eligible for temporary liquor licenses and supports [state legislation](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S2743#:~:text=S2743%20(ACTIVE)%20%2D%20Summary,one%20million%20or%20more%20persons.) sponsored by Senator Jessica Ramos and Assembly Member Inez Dickens and supported by industry groups, such as the NYC Hospitality Alliance, to do just that. ",
            "##### Allow bars and restaurants to serve customers alcoholic beverages without having to order food.",
            "In July 2020, the Governor passed [Executive Order 202.52](https://sla.ny.gov/guidance-requirement-licensees-premises-service-privileges-serve-food-alcoholic-beverages), in which all licensed establishments with on premises privileges (e.e. Restaurants, taverns, manufacturers with tasting rooms, etc.) shall not serve alcoholic beverages unless such alcoholic beverage is accompanied by the purchase of a food item. The order was originally intended to prevent rowdy customers from laxing on social distancing regulations, but it has harmed establishments that do not have kitchens, disincentivized diners from patroning some bars, and put added costs on these venues. In a world in which more and more people are [being vaccinated each day](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-vaccines.page) and eateries continue to uphold strict social distancing and other safety measures, it is time for this pandemic-era regulation to be revoked. ",
            "##### Allow seating at a bar for patrons in NYC, the same standard as for the rest of the state.",
            "[According to the SLA](https://sla.ny.gov/phase3-guidelines-for-on-premises-licenses), currently bar/counter seating is not permitted at all in NYC, despite patrons from the same party being permitted to sit next to each other in bar areas or at communal tables outside of the five boroughs. The SLA should apply the same rules to NYC bars as those that apply in other parts of the state and permit seating at bars and countertops immediately.",
            "##### Get rid of the arbitrary closing curfew.",
            "Enabling bars and restaurants to [stay open till midnight](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/business/2021/04/19/dining-out-curfew-extended-to-midnight-for-nyc-restaurants-and-bars), extended from 11 PM was a step in the right direction, but this curfew is still arbitrary. By forcing safe, socially distanced establishments to close, we are pushing partygoers into their homes where the virus can go unchecked. Instead, it is time to allow bars and restaurants to stay open to 4 AM, like before the pandemic.",
